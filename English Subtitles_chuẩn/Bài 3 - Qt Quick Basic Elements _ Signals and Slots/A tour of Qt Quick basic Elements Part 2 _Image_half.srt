1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,889
The next thing we want to look at is the

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,660
"Image" element. And this is used to show

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,839
an image on your window. I want this to

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,630
have a width of 100 and height of 100. I

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,539
want this to be down below the "Text"

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,570
element. I'm going to give it an x of 10.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,400
Why not? And a y of 150 so that it is

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,820
below this "Text" element which happens to

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,020
be at 100 in y coordinates. Okay, if we

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,300
run the application like this we're not

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,800
going to see anything.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,980
Okay, that's because we didn't specify

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,899
the "source" property for the image that

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,809
we want to show. There are three

15
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,090
different ways you can specify an image

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,370
that you want to show in an "Image"

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,559
element. And we're going to look at the

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,289
first one. One thing you can do is showing

19
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,930
the image that is located in the working

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,559
directory of your project. And what is

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,390
the working directory of our project?

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,420
Let's go to "Projects" here and you can

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,150
see that we are working with the "Build settings".

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,180
Click on the "Run settings" and

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,400
you are going to see your working

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,710
directory here. In our case it is this

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,470
location here. So I can actually copy the

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,590
entire thing. Hit Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C to

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,250
copy. You can do equivalent commands on a

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,000
Mac. I am going to go in my file system

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,090
and paste in this location. Okay I'm

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,940
going to go there and I am going to

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,640
paste in an image that I had prepared on

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,220
my drive. It is a simple image. So now

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,770
that we have the image in our working

36
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,520
directory. We can say "File", say the name

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,400
of the file and pass in its extension.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
And if we run the application now we

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,970
should see our image in this location.

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,450
Let's run the application. Mm-hmm... you see

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,240
"Learn Qt" here. This is the first way you

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,850
can pass your image. The second way is to

43
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,570
store this image in the resource folder

44
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,020
of your project. And the way you do that

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,640
even if you look here, you see that we

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,660
have a resource file that contains our

47
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,460
QML files. It is this qml.qrc file. But we

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,830
can add our own resource file to this

49
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,020
project. So we can click on the project,

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,490
add new, choose Qt, choose "Resource

51
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,210
file" and choose that, give it a name.

52
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,710
We're going to call it "resource". Hit

53
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,230
"Finish". And you see that this file is

54
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,330
opened here. It is saying "resource.qrc".

55
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,390
And you may notice that it is the

56
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,580
same extension as this qml.qrc file. Ok

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,990
so we want to add the prefix which is

58
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,930
what we would start our paths with if we

59
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,060
want it to point to a file that is in

60
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,030
this resource file. Hit enter. Because we

61
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,030
don't want any prefix and you can

62
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,310
click on "Add files" like this and choose

63
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,430
a file in here. But before we do that I'd

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,820
like to go where our main.qml file is

65
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
stored by right clicking on it and

66
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,850
choosing "Show in Explorer". And I am going

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,520
to add that image of ours in the images

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,730
folder that I am creating right now. Ok I

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,190
am going to paste in the image. You can

70
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,830
see that it is the same image. And now

71
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,490
that I have the image I can "Add files",

72
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,970
choose images and choose our image here.

73
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,920
Now I can go back to our QML file,

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,720
specify a second image. And by the way

75
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,880
you see that it is saying that "This file

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,280
or directory does not exist". Ignore this!

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,900
It is just QT creator not recognizing

78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,959
that this file is actually existing. We

79
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,500
are going to position this thing at 150.

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,260
And here we are going to specify the

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,989
image from the resources. All you really

82
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,070
have to do is to specify the path to the

83
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,500
file relative to the location of the

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,740
main.qml file. And it happens to be in a

85
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,320
folder called "images" and you can see that Qt 


86
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,639
Creator directly recognizes that this

87
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,310
file is existent. I think we should also

88
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,460
note that we are loading the image from

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,680
the working directory. And this first

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,349
image here, and in this case we are loading.

91
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:49,150
Ok, let's run the application. Ah...huh, "Learn 

92
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,099
Qt". The first one is coming from the

93
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,110
working directory. The second one is

94
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,740
coming from the resource file. There is

95
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,479
another way we can do this, and that is

96
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479
by specifying the full path to the image

97
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,229
that we want to show. Let's copy the

98
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,259
image. Show it at location 300. Why not? 

99
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,289
Okay, if you look on my drive, in the 

100
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,349
D:\artwork\ folder I have this image here. So

101
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,650
I'm going to copy its path. Note what we

102
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:33,539
are doing. And what we can do is saying "file"

103
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,720
specify 3 '/' like this. And

104
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,610
specify the path to the file. We are

105
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,460
going to use '/' and say "Learn

106
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,860
Qt.png" because that's the image that's

107
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,289
we want to use. If we run the application

108
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,789
we are going to see the same image. But

109
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,729
it will be coming from the full path of

110
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,270
the image. I can close this lecture

111
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,979
without showing you that you can also

112
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,590
load images from the Internet by

113
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,889
specifying the URL to the image. I am

114
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,060
going to extend the width of the Item

115
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:20,560
element to 600. Run again. And you're going to

116
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,509
see that we have a little more space to

117
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,389
work with. I am going to go to our

118
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,630
website and just grab some image. Okay so

119
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,219
I'm going to copy image location. And if

120
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,740
I paste this in another tab you're going

121
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,560
to see that. This is the path to this

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,050
image and we see it in our browser. So

123
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,980
what we can do

124
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,530
is copying this. Come back to Qt creator.

125
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,310
We are going to store this here. I don't

126
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,560
want to type all this things. So I am

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,580
going to just copy this. Put this here

128
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,970
and grab our URL to the image, and use it

129
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,060
as the source property for our image

130
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,260
here. We also want to move the image to

131
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,720
the right because we don't want it to

132
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,850
overlap with this image here. Actually

133
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,620
let's do that because I want you to

134
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,780
see this. I don't think that I showed you

135
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,670
this. Let's run. Mm-hmm, you see that this

136
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,530
is the image that is coming from the

137
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,900
Internet. But one thing is happening here.

138
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,960
You are seeing that the image from the

139
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,810
Internet is overlapping with the image

140
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,360
that we had that was coming from the

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,730
full path, which is this one here. So you

142
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,680
have to be careful to not make your

143
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,200
elements overlap if that's not what you

144
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,420
want to achieve because this can be very

145
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,580
hard to debug. So what we're going to do

146
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,640
is put this image at x of 415. And if we

147
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,940
run, things are going to be normal. Here

148
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,340
is our image from the Internet.

149
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,890
Okay, this covers all we set out to do in

150
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,870
this lecture. And I hope by now you have

151
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,030
a better idea of how you can work with

152
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,020
item Rectangle, Text and Image and how

153
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,360
you can use Item to group items together.

154
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,820
In the next lecture we're going to show

155
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,430
you how you can build your own items by

156
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,650
combining some of the items we've seen

157
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,780
in this lecture. I'll see you in the next

158
00:08:28,780 --> 00:00:00,000
lecture.
