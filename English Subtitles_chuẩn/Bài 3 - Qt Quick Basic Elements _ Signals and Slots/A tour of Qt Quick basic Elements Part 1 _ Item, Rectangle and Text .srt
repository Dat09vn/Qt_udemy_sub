1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
and this lecture we are going to visit

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,730
some basic elements in qml this include

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,630
things like rectangle image and text but

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,790
before we start I'd like to visit one

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,309
element which is the parent of all the

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,500
visual elements that we have used so far

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,289
and many others and that element is

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,630
called item let's go to the

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,320
documentation and look at it which I can

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,420
item here hit enter and you choose item

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,360
qml type choose the letters version of

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,480
Qt have installed here and if you look

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,480
at the description it says the item type

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,600
is the base type for all visual items in

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
QT quack and if you look at the

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
properties that it has we have been

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,410
using some of these properties you can

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,559
see that it has properties of anchors we

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,989
have been using anchors sent in parent

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,600
there are many anchors as we are going

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
to see and this properties comes from

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,870
the parent item and other elements like

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,939
rectangle and text happen to inherit

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,130
this so what we're going to do is create

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,500
a critical project and play with this

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,100
dance for you to see them in action hit

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,869
file new project we call the project key

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,619
ml basic elements demo store it in a

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,060
location on our drive hit next and

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,970
choose your kit which is desktop for now

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,799
we're going to it next and finish we are

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,979
going to change the title here and

33
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,810
create an item element I think this is

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,479
the first time we use this we give it an

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,270
ID this property also comes from the

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,220
item we'll give it an X location of 50 a

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,040
Y location of 50 and by the way you can

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,590
specify your properties on one line like

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,799
this by separating them with a semicolon

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,799
the other thing you can do is this this

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,750
is also another syntax that is

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,690
acceptable in KML and I find myself

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,570
mixing distance

44
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,400
okay inside we're going to put a

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,410
rectangle you already know the rectangle

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,950
the width is going to be 15 the height

47
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,300
is going to be 15 the color is going to

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,940
be red and inside we're going to put in

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,240
a mouth area that is going to fill the

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,480
entire rectangle so it's going to say n

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,080
course and we want to know when this

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,330
mouth area is correct

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,280
the other thing we want to do is to give

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,190
this rectangle a fixed position we are

55
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,180
going to put in at X 10 + y 10 and we

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,980
are going to define other rectangles as

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,840
well just like this one but we are going

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,150
to change the x position and the cutter

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,010
so this one is going to be at X of 60

60
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,920
it's going to be green another one that

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,790
is going to be at 120 and it's going to

62
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,709
be blue and another one that is going to

63
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,110
be at 180 and it's going to be magenta

64
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,760
what do you think we'll see when we run

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,980
this application we're going to have

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,340
this item wrap around this rectangle and

67
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,160
the coordinates of laying out these

68
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,320
rectangles are going to start at this

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,050
location because this is the wrapper

70
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,630
container around these rectangles let's

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,370
run the application so that you see

72
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,920
yourself so what is happening the red

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,100
and green rectangles are touching each

74
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,800
other okay let's put this back to zero

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,250
so that they don't touch each other okay

76
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,709
this is much better to make things much

77
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,410
more visible I am going to assign a

78
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,800
child rectangle to this item and make it

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,709
feel the entire item so I'm going to do

80
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,510
something like this

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,810
and I'm going to give it a color of

82
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,230
beige okay why am I doing this it is

83
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,380
because the I am element doesn't support

84
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,470
this color property and I wanted to put

85
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,540
in a rectangle which has a background

86
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,730
color so that things are invisible I'm

87
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,100
also going to give this a border and we

88
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,470
are going to give our item here a width

89
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,990
and height so the width is going to be

90
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,850
something like 400 why not and the

91
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,840
height is going to be 300 let's run

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,690
mm-hmm and you see that our item is

93
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,810
wrapping around this beige rectangle and

94
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,120
you can see that the elements inside the

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,760
item are laid out in the coordinate

96
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,300
system of the item you can see that X is

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,530
zero for the red rectangle and Y is 10

98
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,830
starting counting from the origin of the

99
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,410
item rectangle I hope this makes sense

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,560
and the others also keep increasing in X

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,230
the green rectangle is at a slightly

102
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,169
higher value of x and the some things

103
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,390
happen for the blue rectangle and the

104
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,900
magenta rectangle here ok one thing you

105
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,220
should notice is that there are some

106
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,169
properties that come from the item

107
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,260
element and some of these are I D X Y

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,840
width and height if we go back to the

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,700
documentation we're going to see those

110
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,860
you see X Y Z we have the width here and

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,979
if we go up we can find the height here

112
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,720
so these are the properties that are

113
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
coming from the item but there are

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,530
properties that the item doesn't have

115
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,470
and some of those include color and

116
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,320
border here because an item is not

117
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,810
supposed to be visible it can't have a

118
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,410
color like rectangle does one thing I

119
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,900
want you to see is that you can use the

120
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
item element to wrap around other items

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,500
we have actually done that by setting

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,470
the X&Y position for the item element

123
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,780
you can see that they start here so if I

124
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,610
comment out this

125
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,909
you wait to see that this beige

126
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,729
rectangle which is our item really is

127
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,039
going to move back to 0-0 from the

128
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,789
parent which is this window element

129
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,039
let's run again okay you see that it

130
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,919
starts at zero we are able to manipulate

131
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,800
all these elements just by manipulating

132
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,069
the X&Y position of the item element and

133
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,379
I hope this drives home the point that

134
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,929
you can use the item element to group

135
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,239
different elements together and carry

136
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,149
out group manipulations to the contained

137
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,169
items let's uncomment this back and give

138
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,669
it an x value of 150 why not run again

139
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,379
and you see that it moves slightly to

140
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,009
the right

141
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,469
another element I want you to look at is

142
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:29,059
the text element so let's use it down

143
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:33,709
here we give it an ID and we can give it

144
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,899
a text property which is the text that

145
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,329
is going to be shown so we can type in

146
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:38,809
here

147
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:45,740
this is my text and if we run this what

148
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,839
shall we see let's run you see that we

149
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,499
see this is my text to the top of the

150
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,740
rectangle that wraps around our item

151
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,259
element and the text is shown at

152
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,349
position zero zero which means that when

153
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,199
you don't specify the X&Y position for

154
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,019
your element it is going to be at zero

155
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,509
zero okay you should know this because

156
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,179
we want our text to show down below the

157
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:16,999
rectangles we are going to give it an x

158
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:22,069
value of let's say 100 and the y value

159
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,819
of 100 another thing we can specify for

160
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,219
this text element is the size of the

161
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,469
font and we do that by using their

162
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,529
grouped font property and calling point

163
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,979
size we can specify 20 here let's see

164
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,698
what we get mm hmm this is my text these

165
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,009
are the different basic properties you

166
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,089
can use on the text element and

167
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,550
as usual if you need to know more about

168
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,300
it you can select it hit f1 and you're

169
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,029
going to have its documentation up in

170
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,970
the text items can display both plain

171
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,240
text and rich text for example red text

172
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,610
with the specific font and size can be

173
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,730
defined like this hello world font

174
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,889
family her vertical point size desu and

175
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,519
color red let's actually copy this why

176
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:24,240
not come back to our text and put in

177
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,779
these properties hey control a control I

178
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:38,399
to align distance run again mm-hmm and

179
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,430
we have our text here and the font

180
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,470
property deserves a little bit more

181
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,999
attention because I don't think we

182
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,610
talked about it yet the font property is

183
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,519
a grouped property and that refers to

184
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,339
the fact that you can call font family

185
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,040
font down point size so to look at this

186
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,660
property let's go back to the

187
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:06,569
documentation and type the font click on

188
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:09,360
the latest version of cute we have

189
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,059
installed and you can see a font value

190
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,639
with the properties of cue font okay

191
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,120
it's like a cue font data type from the

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,360
c++ side of cube it is a grouped

193
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,360
property which means that it has many

194
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,639
properties grouped together you can

195
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,220
specify the family of the font you can

196
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,100
specify whether or not it's bold italic

197
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,160
underline point size and many others you

198
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,230
can use the font like this and this is

199
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,509
really what we have been doing they just

200
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,360
specify more properties than we did we

201
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,800
can copy this then and take it out and

202
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,689
we can specify these properties on one

203
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,300
line like this if you want to it's going

204
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,610
to work okay it's bold now another way

205
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,040
you can specify the font is by grouping

206
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,460
things together like

207
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:10,180
so you can say font-family just like

208
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,340
this and keep specifying the other

209
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:19,260
properties on different lines and

210
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:28,030
whether or not it is bold if you run the

211
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,770
application we are going to see the same

212
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,690
thing okay the same time and these are

213
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,820
different syntaxes that are available to

214
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,950
you to specify grouped properties

215
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,530
another thing you can do if you want to

216
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,180
is to specify this stance on one line

217
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,110
we're going to do that

218
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,420
you can actually copy this put this on

219
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,180
one line and separate things using

220
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,160
semicolons like this and this is going

221
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,060
to work as well okay this is the 10th

222
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,520
element and how you can specify some of

223
00:12:00,520 --> 00:00:00,000
its properties
