1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,520
text area Qt Quick Control, this

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,610
control is used to collect multi-line

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,429
text information from the user. We're

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,620
going to go to QT creator and play with

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,260
that okay here we are in Qt creator.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,859
we're going to create a new project so

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,920
Qt Quick application as usual we call it

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,080
text area demo hit next choose our

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,308
Qt version, we choose our kit here

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:39,079
and finish we want to import QT quick

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,579
controls we import the latest version we

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,300
have install which is 2.4 we say what

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,420
this demo is about I want you to put in

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,730
a column component give it a spacing of

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,140
40 and make its width equal to the width

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,030
of the parent inside the one to put a

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,150
label that is label what we wanted, 

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,570
do ctrl a and ctrl I to align this and

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,619
down here I want to put a text area

21
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:22,490
component I wanted to have a width of

22
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,759
600 a height of 115 I want it to be

23
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,740
centered so I'm going to say 

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,759
anchor.horizontalCenter is parent horizontal

25
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,299
Center we can give it a color which is

26
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,119
going to be the color of the text let's

27
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,220
put in red we can give it a wrap mode

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,470
we're going to put in TextArea.wrapMode, if

29
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,040
we go back to text area and look at some

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,299
of its properties it inherits from text

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,520
edit I don't think we explained this

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,729
wrapMode so this is a good chance

33
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,580
to talk about it. Set this property to

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,239
wrap the text to the TextEdit item's

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,780
width

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,540
okay if the text is longer than the

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,120
available width these are different ways

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,459
you can wrap it to the next line and

39
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,459
they say what all these things do so you

40
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,290
should read this if you are interested

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,110
okay you see the default is NoWrap if

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,690
you don't set wrapping it's not going to

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,670
wrap it's going to try and show this on

44
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,030
one line I also want to put in a text

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,510
property it is going to show a long

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,840
piece of text that cannot fit on one

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,510
line we want this let's run and you see

48
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,680
that we have our text displayed in here

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,380
we are using this text area for now to

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,900
display some text but you can also use

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,450
it to do edit on and capture what the

52
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,330
user has typed then for example you can

53
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,880
delete some text and put in some text of

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,780
your own and you see that as we type

55
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,550
more gibberish here the text disappears

56
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,209
in the area that we cannot see so if you

57
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,519
want to see all your text it is a good

58
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,519
idea to wrap your text area inside a

59
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,370
scroll view and that's what we're going

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,370
to do so we're going to put a scrollView

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,970
component here and take all our text and

62
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:44,100
put that inside our Center and should

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,060
move to the top so the root level of

64
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,420
this ScrollView, and our width and height

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,480
properties should also fall out the same

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,840
they should move to the root level and

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,959
if you run now it looks like it is the

68
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,150
same but when we have hover on top of this

69
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,670
you see that there is a scroll bar to

70
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,880
the right indicating that we can scroll

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,329
up and down in our text here and another

72
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,980
thing I want you to see is that you can

73
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,649
specify a background component for your

74
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,339
text area so you can say something like

75
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,950
that ground and we are going to put in a

76
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,380
rectangle component why not

77
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,040
and even the color of black and we want

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,560
to change the text to white because it's

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,010
going to be on top of a black background

80
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,340
let's run mm-hmm

81
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,840
this is better I like it now when you

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,930
want to use your text area as a data

83
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,750
collection element how do you capture

84
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,060
the text that the user type then we're

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,150
going to disable the text property here

86
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,680
and put in some placeholder text they're

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,550
going to say placeholder and we're going

88
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,640
to say Type in your query when we run

89
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,160
this it's going to say type in your

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,530
query we should provide a button

91
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,650
component at the bottom of the ScrollView

92
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:30,960
component and say submit in the

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
button

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,540
we should Center it in the middle and

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,230
when the button is clicked we would want

96
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,990
to capture the text inside this text

97
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,030
area so it is a good idea to give it an

98
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:56,550
ID right now and we should say console.log

99
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:09,650
the text inside the text area is and

100
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,510
put in the text that we have in there so

101
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,920
we're going to say text area ID text

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,810
let's run okay this is what we have it

103
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,910
says type in your query the moment you

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,280
start typing something the placeholder

105
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
goes away and if you delete again the

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,790
placeholder comes back and if you type

107
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,720
in some text for example

108
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,680
something like this if you click Submit

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,530
you see the text here and of course in a

110
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,479
real application you should do some

111
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,389
validation on the text that you get from

112
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,849
the user okay this is all I have to say

113
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,639
about the text area component it really

114
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,250
is easy to use you just stuff it in your

115
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,500
user interface if you want to have

116
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,750
scroll bars around it when you have a

117
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,330
longer piece of text you should wrap

118
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,240
this inside the scroll view element in

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,069
the next lecture we're going to talk

120
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,219
about the text field QT quick control

121
00:07:26,219 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you then
