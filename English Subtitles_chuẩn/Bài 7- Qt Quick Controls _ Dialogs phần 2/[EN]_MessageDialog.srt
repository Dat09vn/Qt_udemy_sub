00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
In this lecture, we want to look at the

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,190
MessageDialog component. You use this to

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,990
pop up messages for the user and let

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,300
them choose something by clicking a few

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,580
buttons that are available.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,679
We're going to go to Qt Creator and play with this.

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,590
Here we are in Qt Creator, we are

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,350
creating our project. It's a Qt Quick Application.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,080
We call it 'MessageDialogDemo',

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,449
save it in a location on our drive,

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,199
choose our Qt Version, choose your kit

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,160
and finish. We want to change the title

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:44,040
to 'MessageDialog Demo', 'import' 'QtQuick.Controls'

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,270
and 'import' 'QtClick.Dialogs'.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,760
To save you some typing time, I'm going

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
to put in a piece of code I have

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,530
prepared, and try to explain it a little bit.

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,910
It's really simple.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,550
So we have a button here. When you click it,

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,910
we open a dialog and this dialog is a

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,240
MessageDialog. It has an 'id', a 'title' and

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,630
the 'text' property that is going to be

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,299
shown in the message dialog. You can

24
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,280
specify the buttons for the user to

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,460
click. We want to have an 'OK' button and a

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,950
'Close' button and we want to know when

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,720
this dialog is accepted and rejected.

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,170
And if it's accepted we say something.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,330
If it's rejected we also say something. 

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,460
It's really this simple. We want to run the application

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,110
and see how it works.

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,009
It is a pop-up dialog that lets the user

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,500
know something about your application.

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,020
Click this button and you see it says

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,450
something. So this is the text property

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,700
that we specified in here. You see that

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,530
it says this piece of text here. When we

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,219
hit ok and accept, we have the message

39
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,930
from 'onAccepted', if we close we have a

40
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,270
message for 'onRejected' signal handler here.

41
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,509
And this is really all there is for

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,869
the MessageDialog. We can click F1 when

43
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,319
we have it selected, go to full help mode

44
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,450
and have more information about it.

45
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,549
This is all I had to say about the message dialog.

46
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,859
The next lecture we're going to

47
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:21,420
see how you can use your custom dialog

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,120
to have something, at least

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:00:00,000
usable on mobile devices. I'll see you there.
