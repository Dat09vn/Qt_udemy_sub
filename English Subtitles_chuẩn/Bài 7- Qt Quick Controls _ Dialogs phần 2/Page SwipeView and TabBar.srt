1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
in this lecture we are looking at page

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,400
and table components but to make the

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,950
examples a little bit more fun we are

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,469
going to try use SwipeView component

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,139
again and have something pleasing to the

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,630
eye that the user can play with today.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,960
Go to QT create or and play with us okay

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,779
here we are in QT create or before I

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,970
start any project I want to come to the

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,519
help here and look at the things we are

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,490
interested and I'm going to look at the

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,230
page component and if you look here it

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,690
is a container which makes it convenient

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,170
to add header and footer items to a page

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,690
okay you have a header here you have the

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,940
content and you have a footer if this is

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,219
what you are interested in the page

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,219
component is your thing okay you see

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,140
that we also have a couple of other

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,469
properties that we can use let's look at

21
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,100
the top bar component it provides a tab

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,479
based navigation model okay basically

23
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,290
like what we had in a page indicator but

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,020
now we are using tabs if you scroll down

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,920
here you see a better visual on what

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,540
tabs will look like and this is what

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,390
we're going to try so now let's create a

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,170
new project

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,250
it's a QT quick application we call it

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,400
page tab bar demo save it in the usual

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,189
location choose our QT version choose our

32
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,990
kit and finish we want to change this

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:48,299
title here and say page and something

34
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,110
like this and we want to import our QT

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,329
quick controls module

36
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,070
we are trying to build something like

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,619
this if the user has the ability to

38
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,290
swipe through user interface components

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,750
but down here you see that we have a tab

40
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,110
bar that the user can click on to move

41
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,140
to the location where they desire, it is

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,590
possible to use the tab bar like this.

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,450
Now that the destination is display,

44
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,240
let's start with our frame, We want

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,640
to add a page component, given ID

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,140
of page and we want it to fill the

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,070
entire parent inside we have a swipe

48
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,320
view component because we want the user

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,370
to be able to swipe through the UI

50
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,060
components. ID is going to be swipeViewId and

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,300
it's also going to fill the parent which

52
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,280
is going to be this page component here.

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,450
A page component must have a component

54
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,730
that is the main component inside and

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,790
this SwipeView explained that role for us.

56
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,489
Here the next thing I want to do is to

57
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,470
provide a footer, our footer is going to

58
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,330
be a tab bar component and we are going

59
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,080
to put some tabs inside, we want to give

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,680
it an ID as well and we want its current

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,590
index to be the same as the current

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,650
index for our swipe view component here

63
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,840
so we're going to say swipeViewId

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,230
a current index and we should come here

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,870
and do the same so current index is the

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,570
same as the current index as the tab bar

67
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,790
component now we want to put some

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,370
content in the tab bar so we're going to

69
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,610
say TabButton and we want to give it a

70
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,150
text property of first,

71
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,670
we're going to copy this two times

72
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,709
because we want to have three components

73
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,649
that we can show, this is going to be

74
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,460
second, this is going to be third, you can

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,830
do that and now we want to put something

76
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,100
inside the swipe view here I am going to

77
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,169
put in three image components and set

78
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,229
their source property to something we

79
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,150
are going to get all images from the

80
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,340
internet this time if you want to use

81
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,310
local images you already know how to do

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,370
that please check the swipe view and

83
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,370
page indicator lecture and in fact we

84
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,490
are going to use the same images we used

85
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,600
in that lecture so I'll copy and paste

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,090
this a couple of times and change the

87
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,930
names for these images like this and run

88
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,759
our application mm-hmm we have our thing

89
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,090
here and it should be loading the images

90
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,510
from the internet now okay you see our

91
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,510
image here click on second you see it

92
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,380
click on third you say that and they are

93
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,750
coming right from the Internet

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,880
but what I want you to focus on is that

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,210
this UI you see here is wrapped in a

96
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,849
page component and we don't have to do

97
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,729
any anchoring to have this top bar

98
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,099
displayed here we just use a page

99
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,830
component we give it the main widget to

100
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,320
show which is our SwipeView here

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,590
and then we specify a footer we just

102
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,830
specify the footer component but if we go

103
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,400
to the documentation for page component

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,530
you're going to see that it can also

105
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,280
take a header okay it can be any item so

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,669
let's look at the header here we can

107
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,030
actually copy this example and put our

108
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,700
header on top of our SwipeView here

109
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,360
okay we can change this text here

110
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,480
because we want some static text can we

111
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,670
say Page and TabBar Demo because

112
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,050
that's what we are working on, let's run

113
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,840
okay you see our header here is being

114
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,300
displayed if you want this you can use

115
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,580
it like this you can really put anything

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,980
here even if you want it you could put a

117
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,070
rectangle okay give it a width of parent

118
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,790
with give it a height Oh 50 and give it

119
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,330
a color of red for example and run and

120
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,030
you see our rectangle here header and

121
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,100
footer components are available to you

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,010
to put in whatever is if it to serve

123
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,520
your particular needs. This covers all I

124
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,380
had to say in this lecture it really is

125
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,710
simple to use a page component you just

126
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,190
have to provide the main component which

127
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,800
is the swipe view in this case and then

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,420
you can specify a header and footer

129
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,520
components and put in whatever you want

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
in the next lecture we are going to look

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,830
at the text area component I'll see you

132
00:07:30,830 --> 00:00:00,000
there
