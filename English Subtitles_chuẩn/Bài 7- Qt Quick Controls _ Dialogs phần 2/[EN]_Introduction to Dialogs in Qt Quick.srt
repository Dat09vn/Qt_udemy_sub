00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
In this lecture, we are looking at Qt

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,240
Quick Dialogs. Dialogs allow you to

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,490
show transient information, the kind of

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,440
information you want the user to see for

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,900
one or two seconds and let them choose

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,370
what they want to do with the

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,859
information. You can also use them to let

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,020
the user choose something, for example

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,359
they can use Dialogs to choose files

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,510
in the file system, they can use Dialogs

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,699
to choose colors, fonts and things like

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,160
that. Here we have a few classes we're

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,900
going to look at in this chapter. We're

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,340
going to look at the Dialog class,

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,530
which is the parent of all these

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,860
Dialogs: ColorDialog, FileDialog,

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
FontDialog and MessageDialog. They

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,120
allow you to do these things you see here

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,340
to the right. And if you go to the

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,770
documentation, you're going to find more

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,440
details on this thing here. Another thing

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,780
that should be noted is that these 

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,570
Qt Quick Dialogs are part of the Qt Quick

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,390
Dialogs module as we're going to see.

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,449
And they are mostly meant to be used on

26
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,879
desktop platforms. We're going to see a

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,010
way you can use them on mobile devices

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,619
towards the end of this chapter, but

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,450
mostly you're going to be using these

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,180
Dialogs on desktop platforms. Now we're

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,979
going to look at some of the shared

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,590
properties between all these Dialogs. A

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,310
Dialog can be modal in that it blocks

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,740
the user to do something else until they

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,290
have closed the Dialog. The modality

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,930
can be application-wise in which you

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,479
block action in the entire application,

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,210
or it can be window-wise where you block

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,880
application in the entire window. In the

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,950
Dialogs that allow the user to choose

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,049
something, for example the File Dialog,

42
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,659
the Color Dialog, the Font Dialog, we have

43
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,270
these properties. For File Dialog, you

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,759
want to know the file that the user

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,490
choose or the files if they happen to

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,670
choose multiple files. You can also let

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,590
the user choose a folder, the same

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,649
happens for the color. Color holds the

49
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,610
color that was chosen by the user.

50
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,680
Current Color holds the color that the

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
user has chosen but hasn't confirmed yet.

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,300
You're going to see this. And the same

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,720
happens to Font and Current Font. A Dialog

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,710
is invisible

55
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,050
by default. To make it visible, you can do

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,090
one of two things: you can set the

57
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,460
visible property of it or you can call

58
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,860
the open method, which does that for you

59
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,960
in the background. To make it invisible,

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,540
you set the visible property to false or

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,750
you call the close method. And this is

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,510
all I have to spice up your appetite to

63
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,550
work with the Dialogs in Qt Quick. In

64
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,380
the next lecture, we're going to start

65
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,970
working with them and we're going to

66
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,730
start with the Color Dialog. I'll see

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:00:00,000
you there.
