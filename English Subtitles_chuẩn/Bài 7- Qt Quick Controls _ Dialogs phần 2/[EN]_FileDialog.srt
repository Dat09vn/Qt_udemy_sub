1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
In this lecture, we are looking at FileDialog.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,759
This dialog allows you to choose

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,970
files or folders from your file system.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,610
Let's go to Qt Creator and play with that.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,429
Here we are in Qt Creator.

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,130
We're going to create a new project. It's a Qt Quick Application. 

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,430
We call it 'FileDialogDemo',

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,670
save it in a location on our drive,

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,060
hit next, choose the Qt Version and

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,230
choose our desktop kit. We are going to

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,420
change the title here to 'FileDialog Demo'.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,050
We want to import QtQuick.Controls

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,090
because we are going to need to use a button.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,450
We want to put a 'Column' component

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,760
as usual, 'spacing' is going to be 20. It's

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
going to be in the center and it's going

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,859
to contain a button control. The 'text' is

18
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:13,860
going to be 'Choose File or Folder' and it is going

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,900
to be centered horizontally and when it

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,909
is clicked, we want to know and do

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,850
something. Down below we want to put the

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,590
'Text' component.The 'text' is going to say

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,000
'User hasn't chosen yet' and here we're

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
going to show the path to the file or

25
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
folder that the user has chosen. By

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,439
default, we say this because the user

27
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,579
hasn't chosen yet. We want to set the

28
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,530
'wrapMode' to Text.Wrap. The next thing we

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,930
want to do is to import the Qt Quick

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,119
Dialog module. So we're going to say

31
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
QtQuick.Dialogs.

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,540
It's going to be 1.3 and down here we

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,300
can create one 'FileDialog'. The 'title'

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:29,030
is going to say 'Choose File or Folder'.

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:35,120
We want to give it an ID and we want to set

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,080
another property that is called selectFolder. 

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,459
We want to set this to 'true' and

38
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,980
this says that this dialogue is going to

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,800
be used to only select folders.

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,360
We're going to see that you can set this to

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,620
false to allow the choosing of files.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,260
We want to know when the user accepts the

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,270
dialog and when the user rejects the

44
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,440
dialog. We want to give the 'Text' a ID

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,420
and set the path to the chosen file as

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,900
the text property for the Text here when

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,910
the user accepts the dialog. So we're

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,330
going to say 'textId.text' equals 'fileUrl'.

49
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,260
Now when the user clicks this Button,

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,500
we want to open the file dialog. So we're

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,870
going to say open here and run the

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,630
application. And by now you might see a

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,910
pattern in how you use these dialogues.

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,310
It really is the same you define a

55
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,530
dialog component and when something

56
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,180
happens, when the user clicks a button,

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,030
for example, you open the dialog and you

58
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,100
go from there to do whatever you want to

59
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,040
do with the dialog. Our UI is here we can

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,440
click this button and you see that we

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,930
see a dialog like this. Okay let's go to

62
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,650
'D:' for example and choose 'artwork', choose

63
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,680
a folder and you see that the path to

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,459
the folder is stored in here. Let's try

65
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,030
to choose files with this dialog here.

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,940
You see that I go inside the folder but

67
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,120
I don't see any files inside there

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
because this one is set up to allow us

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,930
to

70
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,990
only choose folders. If you want to

71
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,460
choose files, you can come in here and

72
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:33,610
set this property to 'false' and run again.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,389
Mm-hmm.... Choose file or folder, go in 'D:', go

74
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,970
in 'artwork', you're going to see the files

75
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,020
in here. I can choose one file, click OK.

76
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,479
You see that I have the path to that

77
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,410
file. I can also select multiple files I

78
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,110
guess. Let's try and select multiple now.

79
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,380
We can't we can only select one file but

80
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,650
if we close this and come back to file

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,229
dialog I think we can allow the user to

82
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:14,539
choose multiple files. Let's go there,

83
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:21,410
QtQuick Dialogs and let's see if we have a

84
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,349
property called 'selectMultiple'. Whether

85
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,220
more than one file name can be selected.

86
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,760
By default,

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,220
this property is false. We need to set it

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,470
to true to allow the user to choose

89
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,720
multiple files. So we can say selectMultiple,

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:49,360
set this to 'true', run again.

91
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,880
Click to 'D:', 'artwork' and we can hit Ctrl and

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,190
select multiple files and you can see

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,110
that we have a list of those things in

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,560
here.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,159
If I open you see that there's nothing

96
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,300
inside fileUrl. That's because when you

97
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,090
have multiple files selected, the

98
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,050
affected property is not fileUrl as we

99
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,009
did here. It is fileUrls and let's do

100
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,449
that we're going to say fileUrls and

101
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,849
this is a list. Let's try this. We are

102
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,099
trying to assign a list to a text

103
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,740
property. Let's run.

104
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,320
Mm-hmm.... fingers crossed

105
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,580
We are going to 'D:', 'artwork', you select multiple

106
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,490
files in here. Let's do this and when we

107
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,460
do this, cannot assign a list

108
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,919
to a string. This is a problem. You cannot do that.

109
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,380
But if you want, you can do

110
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,970
something like 2, to set the second

111
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,810
file Url as the text property for this.

112
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:10,530
Let's run. Run the application, choose in

113
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,169
artwork, we're going to choose the first

114
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,130
image here, hold Ctrl down and choose a

115
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,280
few others and if we run you see that

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,010
the image number 4 is chosen because

117
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,180
it is at index 4 in our list of images.

118
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,460
And if you want to show all the files

119
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,830
that have been selected, I hope you

120
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,470
remember this. You can say 

121
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:53,880
'for (var i = 0; i<fileUrls.length; i++)'  and say

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:12,810
'console.log'. Let's say "Value"+i+"is"+fileUrls[i]

123
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,020
 and we pass in the index that we

124
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,900
are at in the loop. Let's run to see if

125
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,530
this works.

126
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,380
Choose file or folder, go in our

127
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,630
directory. You can go wherever you want

128
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,930
in your file system. I'm going to choose

129
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,770
this 5 qml and when I open you see

130
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,289
that 0 through 5, I have files selected

131
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,270
here. I can loop through this list of

132
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,690
file Urls and extract each path that is

133
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,740
stored in there.

134
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,779
And this is really how you use file

135
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,940
dialogue. You can use it to select files

136
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,520
and folders or you can use it to select

137
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
one or multiple files. This is all I had

138
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
for this lecture and the next one we're

139
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,970
going to see how you work with font dialog. 

140
00:08:59,970 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there
