00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
In this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,529
FontDialog, a dialog that allows you to

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,170
choose a font and use it somewhere in your application.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,480
Let's go to Qt Creator and play with this.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,509
Here we are in Qt Creator.

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,370
We're going to create

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,150
a new project as usual.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,449
We call it 'FontDialogDemo',

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,619
save it in a location on our drive,

10
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,099
choose our Qt Version, choose our desktop kit,

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,399
and we are here. We want to 'import'

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:42,809
'QtQuick.Dialog', let's import 1.3.

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,059
We also want to 'import' 'QtQuick.Controls'

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,829
because we want to use a button control also,

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,920
so we're going to say '2.4', the

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,730
last version we have available as of now.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,800
We change the title here to say

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,899
'FontDialog Demo' and we put a 'Column' here, inside.

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,229
You must be familiar with this already.

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,439
'spacing' 's going to be 20.

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,450
Why not?

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,189
it's going to be in the center and

23
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,110
inside we want to have a 'Button' control.

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,020
The 'text' is going to say 'Change Font'.

25
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,689
It's going to be  in the centered horizontally

26
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,619
so we're going to say this.

27
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,750
'parent.horizontalCenter' and when it's clicked,

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,170
we want to start a dialogue. Okay we're

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,170
going to say 'fontDialogId'. Okay we

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,240
don't have this dialog yet, but we're

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,979
going to have it and this is going to work.

32
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,890
Down here we want to put a 'Text' component.

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,729
Its 'ID' is going to be 'textId',

34
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,560
the 'text' is going to say 'Hello World'.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,610
And down here we want to have a 'FontDialog',

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,880
ID is going to be 'fontDialogId',

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,080
the 'title' 's going to say 'Choose Font'.

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,710
I want to give it a default font of

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:36,060
this one. Okay this is how I specify it.

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,730
I use the Qt global object and I pass in

41
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,680
the font that I want to say. I hope you

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,450
remember this from the Qt global

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,300
object. And you can see that. This is a

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
grouped property, you can specify many

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,709
things on this font. This is going to be

46
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,380
the default font, that is shown when we

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,290
open this dialog here. Okay when it is

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,000
accepted, we also want to know and we

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,660
want to know, when it is rejected too.

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:14,720
On rejection, we want to say 'console.log' and

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,820
when it is accepted we say 'console.log',

52
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,299
say the font that was chosen and we say

53
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,239
it like this. We also want to take the

54
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,060
font and set it as the font property for

55
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,580
the text here. So we're going to say

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:40,049
'testId.font' equals 'fontDialogId.font'.

57
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,110
Okay the font that the user selects is

58
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,590
going to be available in the font here.

59
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,420
I think we can run the application now and

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,340
see how it behaves. If you click the button,

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,380
you see that you have a window

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,200
here to choose the font. We can choose a

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,680
font.

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,959
Okay let's increase the size here, make

65
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,930
it 48 for example and choose my favourite

66
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,810
font, which is 'Consolas'. Let's see if we

67
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,280
can find it. 'Consolas' is here. If I hit 'OK',

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
you see that the font here changed.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079
This is really how you use the font

70
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,690
dialogues and you can then capture the

71
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,600
font and set it to other UI components

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,750
that have the font property like we did

73
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,060
here for the 'Text' component. This is all

74
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,800
I've to say in this lecture. In the next

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,419
one we're going to see how you can use

76
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,730
MessageDialog to pop up some messages

77
00:04:32,730 --> 00:00:00,000
for the user. I'll see you there
