1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
you use a text field when you want to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,520
collect one-liner pieces of text from

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,950
the user we're going to go to QT creator

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,630
or and play with this Qt quick

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,490
component, in QT create or we create our

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,740
new project we call it text field demo

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,650
save it in usual location, choose our QT

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,340
version and choose our kit we want to

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,930
include our QT quick controls module and

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,149
we want to state what we are doing in

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,210
this lecture. A text field is really

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,430
something like this you see here it's a

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,329
step in your first name I can say Daniel

14
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,449
and I can do something with the data in

15
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,370
here for example can collect it when the

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,039
user hits this button so right now we're

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,570
going to do the structure like this

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,410
we're going to go back to our code and

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:07,170
put a column component inside we'll put

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,840
a spacing of 20 and we want to Center

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,869
this in the parent so we're going to say

22
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:18,689
the usual instead. We want to put another

23
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,280
row component put some spacing of 30 and

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,270
give it a width of 300 and this row

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,860
component is going to have a Label

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,530
component that says first name and we're

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,780
going to have a text field element to

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,840
capture that first name from the user so

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,700
we're going to put in a Label component

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,930
like this, Ctrl A Ctrl I to align

31
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,750
it basically has a width and height we

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,329
specified the wrap mode and we align

33
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,990
tents in the center and the text says

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,729
first name if you want to know about the

35
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,799
Label component you can come to the

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,170
documentation and look at it the label

37
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,810
extends Text with styling and font

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,200
inheritance, okay add some features to

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,409
detect what we have seen now we can add

40
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,970
in our text field

41
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,730
we can give it an id

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,280
they better width of 200 for

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,480
example give it a height of 50 I think

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
it has a placeholder - yes it does so

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,650
you can say first name or type in your

46
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,450
first name invite the user to do

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,840
something and if you look at this

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,300
component in the documentation let's go

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,060
to f1 you see that it inherits TextInput

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,880
component we have seen before if

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,010
you go to it you're going to see some

52
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,770
signals that this thing has, and one of

53
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,110
them is added and finished that is

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,180
emitted when they returned key is

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,660
pressed or when this component loses

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,380
focus so you can use it to know when to

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,290
capture the text that is inside because

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,840
you can say onEditingFinished

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,370
console.log text edit finished and show

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,190
the new text which is going to be

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,280
available in the text property of this

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,480
thing here so down here below there are

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,160
component we're going to put a button

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,460
remember that this is a column component

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,470
that we are inside so we can keep adding

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,760
stuff to it the text is going to say

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,510
click and then the on click event we are

68
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,640
going to capture the text that is in the

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,830
text field we can do this and we pass in

70
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,250
the textfieldID and capture the text

71
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,040
property let's run the application and

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
see what we have so far ok we have our

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,579
thing here and you see that this click

74
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,460
button is not centered but that's not to

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,889
be deal

76
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,740
I type in Daniel and when I click this

77
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,129
you see that I am capturing the two

78
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,669
signals one is coming from the fact that

79
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,629
the text field is losing focus and 

80
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,789
onEditingFinished is being emitted and

81
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,780
inside we are type in text edit finished

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,080
ok we should say finished and the other

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,060
one is when we click on this button and

84
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,729
it says text is Daniel you can use

85
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,310
whatever way you find more convenient to

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,770
capture your text. And ladies and

87
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,779
gentlemen this is all you need to know

88
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,939
about the text field component it really

89
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,509
is very easy and you use it to capture

90
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,849
one-liner pieces of text from the user

91
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,860
and the next lecture we're going to look

92
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,189
at the split view in Qt Quick Control I

93
00:05:18,189 --> 00:00:00,000
see you there
