1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
In this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,990
the Application Window Control. Along the

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,420
way, we're going to look at menus, menu

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,519
bars and stack view. The Application

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,980
Window Qt Quick control gives you

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,769
ready-made spaces where you can stuff in

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,750
your content. You have a menu bar for

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,880
example, you have a header and you have

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,460
the footer, and you have the main content

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,830
area. If you look at what we have on the

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,300
right here, which is what we're going to word 

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,910
in this course by the way, the file

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,760
edit hub thing here is the menu bar. In

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,610
the header, we have put these buttons.

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,860
These are really convenient buttons for

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,500
menus that are inside these file edit

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,719
help menus. We have the main content

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,239
which contains these rectangles here and

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,579
we have a footer which contains our 

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,649
Tab bar. And to be able to navigate through

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,870
these pages, we are going to use a StackView,

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,329
and you're going to learn how to

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,699
use that too. We're going to go to 

24
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,610
Qt creator and do all this. Here we are in

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,980
Qt creator, we are going to create

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,620
our project. It's Qt Quick Application.

27
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,650
We hit Next,

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:13,170
choose our Qt version, we choose our kit

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,939
and click Finish. We want to import Qt Quick

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,229
controls and we want to change the title

31
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,990
here to say ApplicationWindow Demo.

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,049
Let's put a space in here, go to the

33
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:37,650
documentation and look for this. If we go

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,079
to the description of this, it is a

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,509
window which makes it convenient to add

36
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,090
menu bar, header, footer and things

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,970
like this. And you have it here, this is

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,490
how you word it, and you have all these

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,920
components that you can work with: menu

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,890
bar, header and footer and you put in

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,869
some contents inside. This is exactly

42
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,579
what we're going to do in this lecture.

43
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,909
Let's go back to our code and change our

44
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,680
Window here to the ApplicationWindow,

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,330
and what we should do is come here to

46
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,709
speed up things a little bit.

47
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,239
We're going to copy all these things

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,129
because we're going to need them, so no

49
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,310
need to type them again. The Qt 

50
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,109
documentation has done the job for us,

51
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,030
and we're going to fill in these

52
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,139
placeholders. Click Ctrl A, Ctrl I to align. But

53
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,269
before we go any further, I want to

54
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,609
explain a little more on the StackView. 

55
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:40,290
I'm going to click F1, open in full mode, and

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,060
it basically is a component that can be

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,010
used with a set of inter-linked

58
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,889
information pages. It allows you to have

59
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,260
a stack of UI components as you see here,

60
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,159
and you can do many operations on them.

61
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,889
You can push new items to the stack, or

62
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,189
you can pop or remove items from the 

63
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,449
stack. You're going to see how we use

64
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,790
this, I just want you to have an idea of

65
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,430
what we are using here. Let's close this

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,120
and work on our Menu bar. It is basically

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,939
going to contain menus. So our menu bar

68
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,780
here is going to contain three menus:

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,449
the File, Edit and Help menu. So we're going

70
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,979
to say Menu here, and you can learn more

71
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,560
on this by going in the documentation

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,359
yourself. It really is easy and you

73
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,759
probably know how to navigate the

74
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,189
documentation by now. A Menu can

75
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:36,400
have a title, so we're going to say File

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,310
here and the way you put content inside

77
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,699
in a Menu, you use an Action element. I am

78
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,409
going to put in an Action that I had

79
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:48,340
prepared. Type Ctrl A, Ctrl I to align. Let's go

80
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,949
to the documentation for it and you're

81
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,349
going to see that an Action represents

82
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,659
an abstract user interface action that

83
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,239
can have shortcuts and can be assigned

84
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,180
to menu items and toolbar buttons.

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,250
It basically is something you can have

86
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,609
in the Menu, in the toolbar and you can

87
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,409
have shortcuts for it. One of those

88
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,479
things for example is to copy

89
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,669
something, you can have a UI

90
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,590
component to allow you to copy in the

91
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,048
toolbar, you can have it in the menu and

92
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,298
you can have shortcuts for doing that.

93
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,909
So this is what we have here in our

94
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,740
code. It is an Action. This is a New, File

95
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,610
menu items that we’re going

96
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,129
to have. We can specify an icon for it,

97
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,919
and we can know when it is triggered.

98
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,020
When the user clicks on this Action in

99
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,509
the Menu, we're going to know. You

100
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,729
see that it also has an icon source

101
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,039
property. This is how you specify an icon

102
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,560
for it. I think this is a chance we have

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,189
to provide these icons. So I am going to

104
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:51,069
go to the Resources folder here, click Add New,

105
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,759
Qt, Qt Resource File,

106
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:03,729
I choose resource here. I add a

107
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,939
Prefix, you probably know how to do

108
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,120
all these. And I need to go where these

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,889
things are stored on my drive and add a

110
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,889
new Images folder. I am going to go in

111
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,990
the folder and paste in a bunch of

112
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,740
images that I had prepared. These are

113
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,409
the icons and you can see that it is a

114
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,659
set of different actions you can do in

115
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,240
your application. So what I want to do, I

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,060
want to come back to our resource file,

117
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,270
go inside this folder, select

118
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,909
everything in there and add it to our

119
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,150
resource file. I'm going to save and if I

120
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,240
come here, this file icon should be

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,389
available now. We want to add a bunch of

122
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,900
other actions that we're going to need.

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,300
So we have the New menu item, we have the

124
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,089
Open menu item, we have the Save menu

125
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,669
item and we have the Save as menu item.

126
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,949
Another thing you can do is separate

127
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,759
menu items in your Menu here. The way you

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,860
do that is you come here and put a

129
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,909
component called MenuSeparator, and

130
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,159
you put it here. there's going to be a

131
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,620
horizontal line separating these menus.

132
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,560
Let's add the last Action in this Menu,

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,009
which is the quitAction. Type Ctrl A,

134
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,279
Ctrl I to align, and you see that

135
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,069
when this Action is triggered, when we

136
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,669
click on the Quit menu item, we are going

137
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,680
to quit the application and you

138
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,199
recognize this Qt.quit method

139
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,629
from the Qt global object that we have

140
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:44,529
seen before.

141
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,499
This is our first menu, we need to

142
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:51,520
do the same for the Edit menu and Help

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,460
menu. I am going to put in those menus, I

144
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,499
have them prepared to save you some

145
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,439
typing. We're going to go down here and

146
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,960
put in those menus. Type Ctrl A, Ctrl I to

147
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,749
align. And you can see that it basically

148
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,360
is the same thing. I put these actions on

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,150
one line to have things readable a

150
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,580
little bit. And you see that we are using

151
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,360
qsTr to make this things translatable,

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,879
you can do that if you want. 

153
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,240
Let's change the first Menu

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,779
here to be like the others. I’m going

155
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,169
to come here and change the title to say

156
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,650
this and change this to File. This

157
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,839
is the way to go, this is the way you do

158
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,270
it in a real application if you want it

159
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,849
to be translatable. This strings here

160
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:41,560
are going to be translatable in

161
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,839
different languages, but we're not going

162
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,000
to go deep into this subject in this

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,899
lecture. Now we have our MenuBar

164
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,389
complete, the next thing we want to focus

165
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,729
on is the ToolBar, and what we really

166
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,370
have to do is adding a bunch of buttons.

167
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,009
These buttons are going to be tool

168
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,979
buttons. We basically put them in like

169
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,399
this. We have a Row component and inside

170
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,680
we have ToolButton with a few

171
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,199
pre-selected actions that we have to the

172
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
top. These are the actions we want to

173
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,699
show up in the ToolBar. We have the New

174
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,990
we have the Save, Save as and Quit action.

175
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,639
If you go up, you can find all these

176
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,580
actions where we define them here and we

177
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,490
give them IDs. The next thing we want to

178
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,860
do is to adding the pages that we are

179
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,469
going to navigate through, and this Stackview

180
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,169
component here. So we're going to go

181
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,229
to this qml qrc file, that's where we

182
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,000
want to add them so that they are with

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,459
the other qml files. Click Add New, Qt, QML File.

184
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:50,190
We call this Page1.

185
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,250
We change this import to say Qt Quick

186
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,820
2.11 because that's what we are using

187
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,990
here. If you come to the main qml file,

188
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,870
you can see it, and we want to have a

189
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,470
rectangle component inside, and we want

190
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,030
its color to be green for example. We

191
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,810
want to do the same to have three pages.

192
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,690
So click Add New, Qt, QML file, it's going to

193
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,160
be Page2, hit Next, we finish this. We

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,100
come to Page1, we copy it and we

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,730
paste it here, and we say this should be

196
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,110
red. Come back here, click Add New, Qt, QML file,

197
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:51,940
it's going to be page3. And we

198
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,450
paste in our thing here which is going

199
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,980
to be blue. We have our pages, now we

200
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,320
can come back to our main QML file and

201
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,490
work on our StackView. It is going to

202
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,440
fill the parents so they did this for us.

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,310
We want to give it an id and stack id,

204
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:18,100
and if you go to its documentation, let's

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,910
see if we can find StackView, you

206
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,030
see that it has a property called

207
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,740
initialItem. It holds the initial

208
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,720
item that should be shown when the Stackview

209
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,810
is created. So we want to assign

210
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,220
Page1 to this property, we show it

211
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,220
like this. And in our footer, we're going

212
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,160
to have a TabBar that is going to allow

213
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,770
us to navigate through all these pages.

214
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,550
The way we do that is we give this TabBar

215
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,160
an id

216
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,839
and we want it's width to be the same as

217
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,680
the parents’ width. Inside we want to have

218
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,990
a few tab buttons, so we're going to say

219
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,040
TabButton. The first one is going to say

220
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:19,480
qsTr(“Page1”),

221
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,420
and we want to do something when it is

222
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,800
clicked. The first thing we want to do is

223
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,350
to take something that is on top of the

224
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,350
stack and remove it, and we do that by

225
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,170
calling the pop method. And we want to

226
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,610
put the Page1 component so that it is

227
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,069
shown on this stack and we put on the top of

228
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,350
this stack immediately, and we do that by

229
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,699
saying mStackId.push. And we want to

230
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,819
give it what to show, the way we refer to

231
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,100
what is in the qrC file here. You

232
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,620
say qrC and you say Page1.qml

233
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,540
because that's what we want to be shown

234
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,019
when this TabButton is clicked. And to

235
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:07,240
make sure that our thing is working here,

236
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,660
we are going to console log the number

237
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,300
of items in the stack. We're going to say

238
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:25,990
console.log(“Number of items:…)

239
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,579
And it’s going to be the depth of the stack.

240
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,589
You can look at this depth property in

241
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,529
the documentation. When you click this

242
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,019
button, we're going to pop whatever is on

243
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,480
the top of the stack, and we are going to

244
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
push the item that we want to put in

245
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,559
there. In this case, it is going to be

246
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,630
Page1.qml here. We want to repeat what we

247
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,300
just did here and do it for all the

248
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,990
items, the remaining two. So we copy and

249
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,160
paste, here we say Page2. Number 3 is

250
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,670
going to be easier now, and here it is

251
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,949
going to be 3. And here it is 

252
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,120
going to be 2,

253
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,260
here it is going to be 3. And ladies

254
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,750
and gentlemen we have everything in

255
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,930
place to test our Application Window thing,

256
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,570
and now it is convoluted there is a lot

257
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,970
of information. Now we're going to run it

258
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,589
and I'm going to try and explain it

259
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,420
again, and I hope you're going to

260
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,450
understand it a little more better. 

261
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,300
we have our application here, ignore this

262
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,010
thing for now, and we can click to

263
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,810
navigate through the pages. The

264
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,040
first page is green, red, blue, which is

265
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,760
what we specified in here: page 1 is

266
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,050
green, page 2 is red, page three is blue. And we

267
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,360
have menus to the top here. If you click

268
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,210
on File, you’re going to see New, Open, Save,

269
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,290
Save As. If you come back to our code, the

270
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,120
File menu has New, Open, Save, Save us.

271
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,750
You basically specify

272
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,779
things you want to have in the Menu bar.

273
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,390
I want to have the File menu, this

274
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,820
menu here. I want to have the Edit menu,

275
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,370
which is this menu here. I want to have

276
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,800
to Help menu, which is this menu here. And

277
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,100
if you come back to our application, you

278
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,980
see these menus here, the File/ Edit menu. The

279
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,690
way you put things inside, you use

280
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,330
actions. This is our Action and a few

281
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,670
properties inside, and it really is the

282
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,160
same thing. The MenuSeparator here, I

283
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,310
hope you saw it. You can see it is

284
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,190
this line here, then we took

285
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,459
a set of predefined actions and put them

286
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,500
in the ToolBar. You have the new

287
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,620
Save/ Save As/ Quit actions in the ToolBar

288
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,580
and it is what we have down here in the

289
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,940
header.// We have a toolbar and we

290
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,529
define ToolButton and passing the

291
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,839
actions that are going to be in here. And

292
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,740
by now, I hope you see that the

293
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,600
flexibility of the Action item is that

294
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,150
you can use it in multiple places. We

295
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,150
define it here in the menu bar and we

296
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,329
are using it in the header component

297
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,300
here, through these tool buttons. An

298
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Action can be used in many

299
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,810
places in your user interface and the

300
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,880
logic that you defined on that action

301
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,430
for example here, the logic that is going

302
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,350
to happen when you trigger this action

303
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,930
is to quit the application. We can

304
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,120
quit the application from the File menu

305
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,940
and we can quit the application from the

306
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,700
tool bar by clicking on this ToolButton

307
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,860
here. And we have to prove what we just

308
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,890
said, we're going to come to File here,

309
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,780
click, you see that the application dies.

310
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,590
We start it again, we click on the Quit

311
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,320
action here in the toolbar, the

312
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,340
application quits.

313
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,040
And the

314
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,500
rest is really specifying the icons in

315
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,110
the Resource folder and making sure they

316
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,420
are available when you pass them to the

317
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,660
actions to be shown like this. And this

318
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,670
is really all there is to working with

319
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,920
the Application Window. You work with it

320
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,990
when you want to take advantage of this

321
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,930
menu bars and toolbars and footer

322
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,440
locations. And you're going to see it’s mostly

323
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,600
used with the stackview component because

324
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,330
it allows you to navigate through pieces

325
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,910
of user interfaces defined in different

326
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,790
components like this, and it makes it

327
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,100
very easy to do. If you go back to the

328
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,540
Help, you're going to see there is a

329
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
bunch of methods that you can work with

330
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,580
with the stack view and you can learn

331
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,590
more about them by clicking on each one

332
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,140
of these. This is all I had to say in

333
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,210
this lecture, I hope you enjoyed it. I'll

334
00:16:50,210 --> 00:00:00,000
see you in the next chapter.
