1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,350
SplitView Qt quick

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,839
control, this is a control that is only

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,719
available in a q-tip quick controls one

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,780
series because it really targets desktop

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,030
it allows you to split your user

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,990
interface into resizable pieces of

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,320
content let's go to QT creator and play

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,680
with us.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,529
okay here we are in Qt creator we're

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,869
going to create our new project it's a

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,269
Qt Quick Application, we're going to

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,510
call it split view demo save it in the

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,129
usual location choose our QT version and

15
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,730
choose our kit finish if we go to the

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,160
documentation and search for split view

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,079
we're going to find the documentation

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,620
for it and I notice that the import is

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,820
one that they suggest for a QT 511 so

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,489
this says that it is from QT quick

21
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,000
controls one series and what it does is

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,950
allow you to design something like this

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,580
you have resizable pieces of user

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,850
interface and you can click on the

25
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,890
delimiter between the two components and

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,049
you're going to have an icon that

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,450
invites you to drag to resize your

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,470
content this is actually easier to show

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,869
that talked about so we're going to play

30
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,659
with us in our code if you go down here

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,759
they show an example of how you can use

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,250
this actually you know what we are going

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,939
to use this we are going to use this so

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,680
let's copy go back to our code and test

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,530
it then you see that there are some

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,750
things that are not recognized we have

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,030
split view is not recognized

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,030
we should import our QT quick controls

39
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,200
controls 1.4 this is the latest version

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,140
we can use now you see that layouts are

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,899
not also recognized so we're going to

42
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,099
import QT quick

43
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,999
layouts we can only import 1/3 and when

44
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,939
we do this you see that our errors go

45
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,049
away we should change this title to say

46
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,239
splitView demo and we can run our

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,670
application but before we run it let's

48
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,889
go through it we have a split view

49
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,069
component it is going to fill our window

50
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,340
here inside we have a few rectangles we

51
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,419
have the light blue rectangle the light

52
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,139
gray rectangle and the light green

53
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,060
rectangle okay they specify the maximum

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,449
width for this rectangle so you can't

55
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,449
extend it parent width this is what

56
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,849
it means we instruct the second

57
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,669
rectangle to fill the available width

58
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,260
and its minimum is going to be 50 inside

59
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,579
we have a text that is centered and the

60
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,939
third rectangle has a width of 200 and

61
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,840
the text components inside as well let's

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,319
run this and see what we have okay this

63
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,780
is basically what we had in the

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,250
documentation if you put your cursor

65
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,419
here you see that we have this icon and

66
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,229
it invites us to resize this thing the

67
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,009
second rectangle can not go below and

68
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,250
minimum width of 15 if you remember

69
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,680
that's why we are saying this behavior

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,150
here let's look at the rectangle one and

71
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,069
see it has a maximum width of 400 so if

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,090
we take this down and keep expanding you

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,500
on there is a width it can go past okay

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,959
this is the maximum for it and you can

75
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,199
see that rectangle 3 the green one here

76
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,370
has no constraints as to how much it can

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,310
grow in wealth it can occupy whatever it

78
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,858
wants and again you see these things are

79
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,250
growing in the horizontal direction you

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,370
can also make them

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,949
grow in the vertical direction and the

82
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,600
way you do that you specify the

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,229
orientation for your fan okay so if I

84
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,220
change this orientation to vertical

85
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:43,889
let's say orientation Qt.Vertical

86
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,780
what else do we need to change we need

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,479
to change all this width property to

88
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,410
height properties so we should say here

89
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:05,110
layout maximum height and say 400 we

90
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,600
should go down here and comment these

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:17,760
two layout and say layout minimum height

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,669
make it 50 and say Layout.fillHeight

93
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,270
make this true we should also set this

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,090
to height instead of width let's comment

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,740
this out so that you have it for

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,539
reference I don't like to delete plans

97
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,780
in lectures like this so we're going to

98
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,919
say height to 200 do we have another with

99
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,120
let's say height here and make it 200

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,990
and if we run now and here is our program

101
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,010
we can expand and shrank our rectangles

102
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,919
as we see in here. These covers all had to

103
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,750
say in this lecture the next one we're

104
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,210
going to look at the drawer QT quit

105
00:06:04,210 --> 00:00:00,000
component I'll see you there
