00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
In this video we are looking at the SpinBox

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,640
Qt Quick control. This control

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
allows you to choose a number by

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,870
pressing the button. On the top one here,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,790
you see that we can select a number by

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,370
pressing this little thing here and on

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,379
the bottom one here, this is a new look

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,109
from QT quick, and this is what we're

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,109
going to look at. You press the plus

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,570
button to increase and the minus button

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,140
to decrease, and you can capture these

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,810
values using any of the methods we have

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,120
seen before. We’re going to go to Qt

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,820
creator and play with this.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,550
Here we are in Qt creator, we

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,160
create a new project as usual. Click

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,210
Qt Quick Application, we call it Spinbox Demo,

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,940
save it in the usual location and

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,670
hit Next, choose a QT version, we choose

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,800
our kit and finish. The first thing we

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,170
want to do is to import Qt Quick controls.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,790
So we say import, go down here

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,810
and choose 2.4, and change the title

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,150
here to SpinBox Demo. We want to put a

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,979
column in here, spacing is going to be

26
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,979
20 and it's going to be the same width

27
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,659
as the parent. If we go to the

28
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,420
documentation and look at SpinBox, look

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,270
at the description, it says it is a

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,250
control that allows the user to choose

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,860
an integer value by clicking the up or

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,920
down indicator buttons, or by pressing up

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,680
or down on the keyboard. It looks like

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,409
this, and this is how you define it. We're

35
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,500
going to go back to our code and put in

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:11,550
a SpinBox. We give it an id. We say where

37
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,640
it starts from, it's going to start from

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,450
1 to 100, this is what we've been

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,360
doing all along. And the value is going

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,120
to start at 20, you can choose whatever

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:32,010
you like. We want it centered and we want

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:51,330
to know when the value changes. Let's run

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,800
and see what we have so far. You

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,230
see that we have our SpinBox control

45
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,099
here, the value is 20 by default, which we

46
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,310
specified. We can decrease by clicking on

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,010
the minus button here and you see that the

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,400
values change accordingly, and when we

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,830
press the plus button here the value

50
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,260
increases, and we are able to capture

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,290
that in our code. One thing you can

52
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,560
specify is the step size, which is the

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,840
increment that is going to happen each

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,900
time you click on the plus or minus

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,950
button. You specify that by using the

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,819
stepSize property. We can specify

57
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,900
5 for example. If we run again, 

58
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,230
we are at 20. We click plus, it's going

59
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,739
to be 25. We click plus again, it's

60
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,080
going to be 30. We are incrementing and

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,099
decrementing by 5 every time we press

62
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,980
any button here. Another thing I want you

63
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,700
to see is that you cannot select inside

64
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,849
the spin box here and type a value. I am

65
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,470
doing that but it is not being

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,319
recognized. So if you want to do that, you

67
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,420
can set your SpinBox here to be

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,230
editable. So we say that and we set this

69
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,820
true, run the application and I can

70
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,209
now delete what is inside

71
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,680
and type 55 for example. Hit Enter and the

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,319
value is changed, and I can increase or

73
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,650
decrease. You can change the value

74
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,110
manually when you set this editable

75
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,509
property to true. The last thing I want

76
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,400
to do in this lecture is capture the

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,770
value here manually without waiting for

78
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,520
the onValueChanged signal. We have been

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,310
doing this a lot because it is more

80
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,139
convenient. When you need the value, you

81
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,270
capture it without waiting for a signal

82
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,090
here. It is very easy to do. We put a

83
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,780
Button here. We center it by using this

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,690
statement here. We copy it and put it

85
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,020
down here, and we want to give it a text

86
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,659
property, say: Capture value. And we want

87
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,500
to know when it is clicked at which time.

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,280
We're going to say: console.log The

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:29,940
current value in the spinbox is :” + 

90
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:37,169
spinBoxId.value.

91
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,219
If we run, change the value in

92
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,360
here to 41, why not? We hit Enter to

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,020
change it, current value changes to 41, we

94
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,820
plus a little bit: 61. Click Capture value, the

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,520
current value is 61. You can capture it

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,820
and use it in your application. This is

97
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,740
really all I had to say about the SpinBox

98
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,320
Control, you can learn more about it

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,530
and its properties from here. There's

100
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,080
quite a bunch, so if you need them and

101
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,150
are interested, you can look at this and

102
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,009
look at what they do in the

103
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,409
documentation here. In the next lecture,

104
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,759
we're going to look at the Application Window component

105
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,000
from Qt Quick controls.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there.
