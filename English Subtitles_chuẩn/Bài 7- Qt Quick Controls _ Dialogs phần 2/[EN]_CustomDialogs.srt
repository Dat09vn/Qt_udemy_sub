00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
In this lecture, we'd like to see how you

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,830
can upword custom dialogues that look

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,990
decent enough to be used on mobile

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,719
devices. This time we're going to do

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,490
something a little bit different than

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,070
we've been doing all along. I want you to

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,949
come to the Welcome tab here in Qt Creator, 

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,109
I want you to come here

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,300
in the search tab and type in "Gallery", 

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,380
and you're going to have a few example

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,170
applications in here. I want you to click

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,769
on this one, the greenish one. We're going

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,780
to run it and see what we can learn from

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,370
it. Okay, you are going to see it opened

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,010
here. I want you to close this window

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,469
here, and you're going to see a configure

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,340
project message here. It is basically

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,410
wanting you to configure the kit for

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,360
this project here because we can click

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,210
on it and directly run it into to Qt Creator, 

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,170
I am going to choose the desktop kit

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,210
but I do recommend to run this on a

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,010
mobile device because it really looks

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,500
good there. Now that I have my kits

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,460
selected, I'm going to configure project.

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,760
And it's going to configure stuff. You

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,520
see that we had a few errors and now

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,890
they've gone away because Qt has done

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,110
the configuration for us. You're going to

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,270
see a new project open here on the Left,

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,790
it's called the gallery. If you go in,

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,220
you're going to find resources. If you

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,259
go down here, you see the resources. This

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,259
is where we have our qml files, but I

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,450
don't know why Qt creator is not

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,970
showing the contents of the qml files.

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,479
But no worries, we can actually click on

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,899
the gallery.cpp file here, show in

39
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,159
Explorer. We're going to open where it is

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,350
located and we're going to see a folder

41
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,799
called

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,049
pages here, which contains different

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,960
pages that we can show. I want you to run

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,719
this application. And you see that we

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,820
have an application like this. It is a

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,020
good one. Okay, you see that if you click

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,389
on this then you see a drawer come up

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,970
here, and they have a bunch of buttons

49
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,980
that you can click to do the

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,840
different things. For example, we can show the

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,599
group box here. They basically showcase

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,879
different Qt Quick Controls that you can

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,209
use in here. We have seen a lot of this

54
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,629
things if not all. But what I want you to

55
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,780
see now is the dialogue because they

56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,420
have pretty good dialogues that we can

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,379
learn from. Click on dialogue here and

58
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,060
they have a few things that you can try.

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,549
Click on message here, it shows a

60
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,530
dialogue with a message, this is pretty

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,129
good for mobile devices. Click on

62
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,569
confirmation here, you have a dialogue. It

63
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,209
has a title, it has a message and you can

64
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,400
let the user check some boxes like this,

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,440
and you can accept or reject the

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,470
dialogue. We have content dialogue that

67
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,140
you can use to show some content and let

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,170
the user scroll. The user can close this

69
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,209
when they are done with it. And we have

70
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,519
another one that can collect user input.

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,220
I think these dialogs look very good and

72
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,870
we're going to try them in our

73
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,720
application. But before we try them we

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,519
need to see the source code that is

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,849
generating them. The way we see that,

76
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,530
unfortunately, this is not opening up in

77
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,750
Qt Creator but we can go there

78
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,329
ourselves and find this things. Click on

79
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:35,370
gallery.cpp here, show in explorer, go in

80
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,950
pages inside here, and you're going to

81
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,459
say a file called dialog page. I want you

82
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,720
to open it with an editor of your choice

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,700
you can actually open it with Qt Creator, 

84
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,090
I guess, you can choose an

85
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,190
application that you want to open it

86
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,389
with. I chose Qt Creator here and it's

87
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,879
going to open here. What we want to see

88
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,489
is how these buttons are generated. You

89
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,169
see we have a Label here that says

90
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,169
dialogue blah blah blah. We have a button

91
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,220
here, and this generates our dialogue.

92
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,470
Okay, when you click you open this

93
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,199
dialogue here. so what we can do is copy

94
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,199
these things and adapt them to be run in

95
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,079
our own application. so I am going to

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,659
keep this dialogue page open here, keep

97
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,349
it open,

98
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,870
I can close gallery here because

99
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,690
we don't need it anymore, and create a

100
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,660
new project. It's going to be Qt

101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,210
Quick Application, we're going to call it

102
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,910
CustomDialogDemo, save it in a location

103
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,280
on our drive. Hit "next", 

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,220
the usual thing really, choose the QT

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,820
version, choose the desktop kit, and

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,160
"Finish". Okay, we have our project here. We

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,250
want to say Custom Dialogue Demo. We also

108
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,039
want to do our imports. We want to import

109
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,800
QtQquick.controls and QtQquick.Layouts

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,020
because we're going to use those as well.

111
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,900
We want to put in a column component.

112
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,720
This spacing is going to be 40 and it's

113
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,360
going to be the same width as its parent,

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,690
so we're going to say "parent.width" here.

115
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,389
What we want to do is to go to dialogue

116
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,449
page here and copy these two components, 

117
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,870
this label here and this button here. We

118
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,200
select, copy this, come back in main.qml

119
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,169
and put them here. This is a column

120
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,000
component so things are going to be laid

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,130
out from top to bottom. We're going to

122
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,680
see this label here and this button, and

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,320
when we click this button, this dialogue is

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,789
going to pop up. One thing you see is

125
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,590
that we have a property that is not

126
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,410
defined, this button width property is

127
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,900
not defined, and if we run without having

128
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,199
it defined, we're going to run into

129
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,810
problems. so we can come to the top here

130
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,889
and say "property int"  and say "buttonWidth"

131
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,580
It is called like that, buttonWidth. 

132
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,010
I think it is true and we want to make

133
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,060
this 300. Another thing you might do to

134
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,220
improve security, you can make this

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,710
readonly in Qt and you can do that.

136
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,210
You can make it readonly, you can do

137
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,099
that. Okay, we have our thing here. so we

138
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,659
have our label, I don't think there's

139
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,670
much to say about the Lable, you're ready

140
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,520
how to work with that. But the button

141
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,310
here, it has a text that is going to be

142
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,380
shown in. It's going to be this width and

143
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,210
when it's clicked, we're going to open

144
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,840
this dialogue here that we defined. And it

145
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,930
has an Id. Okay, so look at the position

146
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,060
we gave it here, we really want to Center

147
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,730
it in the parent. The dialog has also a

148
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,090
title and it has a label inside. Let's

149
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,070
run the application and see what it

150
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,170
looks like now. Okay, 

151
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,890
you see we have this thing here. If we

152
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,560
click here, you have your message here.

153
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,020
This is very easy to do and we just

154
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,720
learned this from a Qt example. The

155
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
next button is going to be a

156
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,010
confirmation button. We want to capture

157
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,430
it and copy it. We go to

158
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,440
main.qml which is here, go below the

159
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,640
button that we had for message and paste

160
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,440
them the confirmation button. Okay, it has

161
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,740
a width as well, we have this dialogue that

162
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,430
we open, and we have a few properties for

163
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,090
this dialogue here. We can run it, click

164
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,670
on confirmation, and you see the title

165
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,370
here, they say a text here, and we have a

166
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,190
checkbox in here. Down below we have two

167
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,980
buttons yes and no. If you click yes, it's

168
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,500
going to accept. If you click no, it's

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,470
going to reject. Let's see what we have

170
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,650
in here. This is how you specify the

171
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,720
buttons. Okay, you say standardButtons

172
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,990
and you pass in these values here. We

173
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,060
want to have a yes button and the no

174
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,310
button. This is how you specify the

175
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,970
content inside the dialogue. We have this

176
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,490
label here, we have this checkbox here,

177
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,580
and the buttons are going to be below

178
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,620
these components that you specify in

179
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,409
here. And the dialog is also going to be

180
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,660
centered in the parent. We want to go to

181
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,420
dialog page again and look at the next

182
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,430
piece of content we

183
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:02,779
have. so we want to copy this button here,

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,930
come back to main.qml, go below this

185
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:13,860
button here, paste it in. Okay, this is a

186
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,550
pretty long one. We give it a close

187
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,020
button like this. It is a modal dialogue,

188
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,520
Inside, we have applicable component

189
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,000
because we want to be able to scroll to

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,839
see all the content inside the dialogue.

191
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,209
Notice that we specified the content

192
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,880
height property here. This is because we

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,209
might have more content to display than

194
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,300
our window could possibly display, so

195
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,440
we're going to have to scroll through

196
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,020
the content to be able to see everything

197
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,630
in there. so we have a Flickable, that is

198
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,510
going to allow us to flick through the

199
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,550
contents. Inside, we have a column

200
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,880
component that contains an image and a

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,339
label with some text. so we need to

202
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,550
provide this image here, and the way I'm

203
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,709
going to do that, I'm going to add it as

204
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,620
a resource file. so I'm going to select

205
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,130
the project here, and say add new. It's

206
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,190
going to be Qt Fesource File. I'm

207
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,240
going to say resource here, I'm going to

208
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,190
add the prefix and take it out

209
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,089
because I want to not use a prefix. I

210
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,880
want to go where my main.qml file

211
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,790
is stored we've been doing this quite a

212
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,450
lot. And I want to add in an images

213
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,150
folder. I am going to open this folder

214
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,930
here and put in my logo here that I'd

215
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,270
prepared. It is called LearnQtLogo,

216
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,800
so I'm going to come back to our project

217
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,220
and select add files, put in images and

218
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm going to find my local in there. I'm

219
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,010
going to save this, come back to main.qml, 

220
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,290
not main.cpp and here I'm

221
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,250
going to say "images...

222
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,370
LearnQtLogo.png. Let's run this

223
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,110
so that you see what it is. Okay, we have

224
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:22,640
content here, and if we run, you see that

225
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,019
the button is not displayed correctly.

226
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,910
Why is that? Let's look at this error

227
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,230
here, 92, and it says page here is not

228
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,040
defined. We should change this to parent

229
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,100
because we don't have the page component

230
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,760
defined. And we want to display this

231
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,700
dialogue here in relation to its parent

232
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,670
which is the button here. Let's run again,

233
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,970
click this, and you see that we have our

234
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,640
content here. Okay, you can scroll to see

235
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,110
things. We can close and open it again. This

236
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,570
is the behavior you have. and in fact, this

237
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,120
dialog is usable on mobile devices. It

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,180
looks pretty decent. so we want to go

239
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,050
back to the DialogPage.qml file and copy

240
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,660
the last button that we have in there,

241
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,130
that's the one we're going to look at

242
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,949
right now. And it is a dialog that you

243
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,670
can use to collect data from the user. We

244
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,579
go down here, paste it inside, look and

245
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,029
see if we have no boo-boos inside. You

246
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,250
can't really see the skin mean. We 

247
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,310
have to run it to see if it works, and

248
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,240
let qml catch the errors for us. Ok, it

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,300
looks like this. It has a title Input and

250
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,440
you can type in stuff, ok,

251
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,250
John Doe, for example, and you can

252
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,010
navigate through the tab key. This is

253
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,380
pretty design. And if you look at how

254
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,380
it's made, it's no different than what we

255
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,990
have seen before. We have a button, we

256
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,149
have a dialog inside. It is centered in

257
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,089
the parent. It has focus, it has a title

258
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,080
we have a bunch of

259
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,570
buttons that we can show in it, and we

260
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,850
have a layout that contains things we

261
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,190
want to see. Okay, this is a layout of our

262
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,030
own input fields, we have a label and we

263
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,780
have a text field for the username and

264
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,060
the text fields for the password.

265
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,540
It really is nothing fancy but it is

266
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,180
very usable on mobile devices. And I

267
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,010
thought it was a good idea to show you

268
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,970
this things.

269
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,760
I didn't want to type all these things. I

270
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,980
could have done that. But I wanted you to

271
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,050
have the information that you can go to

272
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,870
the examples here and find some useful

273
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,970
things you can even learn from and

274
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,130
learn things that I didn't even have a

275
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,900
chance to tell you about in this course.

276
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,390
Okay, this is really all I had to say in

277
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,190
this lecture. I hope you know how to

278
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,580
display good looking and useful

279
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,350
dialogues that you can use on mobile

280
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,830
devices. And in the next lecture, we're

281
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,110
going to look at the interesting subject

282
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,320
of Model View architecture using QT

283
00:14:19,320 --> 00:00:00,000
quick. I'll see you there.
