00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
In this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,980
switch to to quit control this control

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,740
is really like a checkbox but it is more

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
suited to mobile devices we're going to

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,650
go to QT creator and play with it okay

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,949
here we are in QT creator we create our

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,199
new project it's a two to quick

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,470
application we call it switch demo save

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,050
it in the usual location choose our QT

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
version and choose our kit hit next and

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,670
finish we should import our QT quick

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,390
control module change the title to say

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,190
switch demo down here we want to put a

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,539
column component the width is going to be

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,840
the same as or the parent and we give it

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,550
a spacing of 20 so I want to put in a

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,750
couple of switch components so going to

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,890
say switch the text is going to say

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,420
Wi-Fi for example I copied this a couple

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,810
of times this is going to say bluetooth

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,520
and this is going to say NFC.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,960
let's say that we want the user to

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,090
choose the technology that they want to

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,119
use to share data if you look at the

25
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,829
documentation there are a couple of

26
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,960
properties that this switch component

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,950
has, and one of them is checked, you use

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,860
this to control if the switch is on or

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,790
off okay so if we set the Wi-Fi one to

30
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,799
true and run you see that it is turned

31
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,409
on if you turn it off it goes off like

32
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,040
this if you turn it on it turns black

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,920
and it goes to the right okay you can

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,500
also turn on NFC or Bluetooth or

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,129
whatever you want I want to Center my

36
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,770
fence here because

37
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,020
think it looks better if it is centered

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,200
so I'm going to say anchor.horizontalCenter

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
parent horizontal

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,850
Center copy this samething and put it in

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,460
these buttons, another thing you can do

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,070
is disable one of these buttons and all

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,610
you have to do is say enabled and set

44
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,140
that to false and if you run we're going

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,190
to have the NFC switch turned off okay

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,120
it is disabled you can also capture the

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,920
jet state you can say unchecked changed

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:06,510
and say if checked because to true Wi-Fi

49
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:19,580
switch is turned on let's say that and

50
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:32,730
if it is not true we say Wi-Fi switch is

51
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,310
turned off if we run this we turn it off

52
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,430
it is turned off we turn it on it is

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,860
turned on okay you can do all this done

54
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,410
if you want you can see that this is

55
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,540
really no different than a checkbox and

56
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,570
it is a matter of preference which one

57
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,600
you use QT quick does its best to give

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,480
you more components on your menu and let

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,850
you choose what matches better your

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,820
requirements for your project this is

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,770
all have to say in this lecture in the

62
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,990
next one we're going to look at Page and

63
00:04:06,990 --> 00:00:00,000
Tab bar components, I'll see you there
