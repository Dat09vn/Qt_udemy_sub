1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
In this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,230
the ColorDialog component. It is a

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,240
Dialog that allows you to choose a color

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,670
and use it somewhere in your application.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,920
We're going to go to Qt creator and

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,710
play with this. Here we are in Qt

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,509
creator, we're going to go to the

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,910
documentation and type in ColorDialog.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,439
You see that they suggest multiple

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,350
places where we can find this UI

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,170
component. We don't want to choose Qt

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,840
Labs Platform, we want to choose Qt Quick

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,079
Dialogs. We go in there, click on More

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,690
to see the description, and you see that

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,780
we can use this to select a color. The

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,270
Dialog is initially invisible. You need

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,670
to set the properties as desired, then

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,030
set visible-check to true or call open. 

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,489
This is how you use it, you define it

20
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,190
like this. When it is accepted - when the

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,079
user confirms the color that they want,

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,289
you know it in the onAccepted signal

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,899
handler. And when it is rejected - when the

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,520
user doesn't choose anything with this

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,060
ColorDialog, you know in this signal

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,250
handler here. And if you go up, you're

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,049
going to see a few properties. You have

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,369
the color property, which is used to

29
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,259
store the color that the user has

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,650
selected, this is the confirmed color. We

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,080
also have currentColor, which is the

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,270
color that the user has selected but

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,030
hasn't confirmed yet. We are going to

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,229
create a project and play with this. 

35
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,150
Click File, New File or Project. It is an application, 

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,509
a Qt Quick one. We call it 

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,689
ColorDialogDemo, store it in a location on

38
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,329
our drive and use this as the default

39
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,030
project location. You can choose this if

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,180
you want, click Next, choose the QT

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,270
version, and we want to use the desktop

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,420
kit for this. This is our project here,

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,659
we want to change the title here to say:

44
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:05,850
ColorDialog Demo and import Qt Quick

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,600
Dialogs.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,540
You see that the import they

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,290
suggest is 2 but the latest one is

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,950
3 as far as I know. So 

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,330
we're going to put the

50
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,790
rectangle inside here and the user is

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,560
going to click a button to pop up a

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Dialog to let the user choose a color,

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,700
and we are going to use that color as

54
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,790
the color of the rectangle. 

55
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,050
I am going to put in a Column component,

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,020
the spacing is going to be 20, and it is

57
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,990
going to be centered in the parent. We

58
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,790
are going to have a Button on top and

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,160
for having access to Button,

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,200
we need to import Qt Quick

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,420
Controls. So we say: QtQuick.Controls,

62
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,260
let's choose 2.4 and it is recognized. We

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,390
give it the text that is going to show.

64
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,810
You're going to say: Choose Color. It is

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:23,680
going to be centered, and when it is

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,050
clicked, we want to know and do something.

67
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,100
Down here we're going to put a Rectangle

68
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,140
component. We want to put a bunch of

69
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,810
properties inside. Click Ctrl A, Ctrl I

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,800
to align. It has a width and height and

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,670
id. The color of the border is black and

72
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,459
it has a width. It doesn't have any color

73
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,860
set for now, so it is going to be white

74
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,040
by default. We also want this rectangle

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,310
centered, so we can copy this and put

76
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,090
that down here, kill this space to make

77
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,000
things a little bit nicer. And down here

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,420
we're going to put a ColorDialog, we're

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,530
going to give it an id,

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,099
we’re going to give it a title. These are

81
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,049
the properties that you can check in the

82
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,089
documentation. We're going to say: Please

83
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:30,889
Choose a Color. And when it is accepted, we

84
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,960
want to do something and we also want to

85
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,820
do something when it is rejected. We want

86
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,800
to console log the color that the user

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:52,250
chose. We're going to say: console.log. We

88
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,770
want to output the color that the user

89
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,169
chose, it is going to be stored in the

90
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,110
color property. We also want to do an

91
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,110
experiment and say onCurrentColorChanged

92
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:14,590
and say: console.log(“Current color changed”).

93
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,280
When the Dialog is

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,070
accepted, we want to set the color that

95
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,620
the user chose as the color for this

96
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,870
rectangle here. So we're going to say:

97
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:35,090
rectangleId.color = color. This is

98
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,280
the color property of the Dialog here.

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,389
And when the user rejects the Dialog,

100
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,270
we don't want to do anything special, but

101
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,080
we want to log that so that we know in

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,400
our application, so we're going to say:

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,490
User rejected dialog.

104
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,330
I know you have a

105
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,340
temptation to run the application and

106
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,590
see how it looks, but if you click on the

107
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,879
button, nothing is going to happen

108
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,550
because we really didn't do anything in

109
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,030
here.

110
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,069
So we want to say:

111
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:16,979
colorDialogId.open. We want to open the

112
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,280
Dialog. Now you can run to see something

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,849
when you click on the button here. We see

114
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,030
the UI here, click on the button, you see

115
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,039
a Dialog that allows you to choose a

116
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,590
color. Notice what happen when we

117
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,349
choose a color, you see that currentColor

118
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,340
changed and I hope this shows the

119
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,069
point of the difference between currentColor

120
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,430
and color. color is the color that

121
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,729
the user has chosen. When you click

122
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,699
OK to choose this greenish color for

123
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,560
example, it is going to go in the

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,889
rectangle here. This is

125
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,430
the color property right now, but as long

126
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,009
as you haven't confirmed, what you are

127
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,379
changing is the currentColor. I

128
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,719
hope this makes sense. And when you click

129
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,569
OK, you see that your color is applied to

130
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,240
the rectangle here, and this is the

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,020
effect of what we did in the accepted

132
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,650
signal. We set that color property

133
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,289
to be the color of this rectangle here.

134
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,870
And this is really how you use a ColorDialog

135
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,319
to choose a color and use it in

136
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,930
your application. In the next lecture,

137
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,180
we're going to look at the File Dialog

138
00:07:33,180 --> 00:00:00,000
UI component. I’ll see you there.
