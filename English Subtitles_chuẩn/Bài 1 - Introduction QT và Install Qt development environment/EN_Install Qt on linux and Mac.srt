In this lecture, we're going to show you

0:00:01.650,0:00:07.710
how to install Qt creator on Linux and

0:00:04.859,0:00:10.440
on an Mac. Qt happens to be cross-platform

0:00:07.710,0:00:12.929
and you can use it on Windows, Mac and

0:00:10.440,0:00:14.910
Linux. I usually recommend to run a

0:00:12.929,0:00:17.520
Qt creator on these three platforms.

0:00:14.910,0:00:20.670
That's the best way to get its feel and

0:00:17.520,0:00:22.769
how it's used in the real world. But I

0:00:20.670,0:00:25.080
don't own a Mac and it is illegal to

0:00:22.769,0:00:27.210
install it in VirtualBox so I'm not

0:00:25.080,0:00:29.970
going to do that. But I'm going to show

0:00:27.210,0:00:32.430
you how you could do that if you are to

0:00:29.970,0:00:35.880
run it on a Mac. And if you run into a

0:00:32.430,0:00:37.800
problem just ping me in the QA section

0:00:35.880,0:00:40.170
and I'm going to do my best to help you

0:00:37.800,0:00:43.079
out. We're going to go to the official

0:00:40.170,0:00:45.719
download page of Qt. We're going to

0:00:43.079,0:00:49.050
choose official release and we're going

0:00:45.719,0:00:54.949
to be taken here. Once here choose Qt

0:00:49.050,0:00:59.370
we choose Qt 5.10 which was Qt 5.10.1. And

0:00:54.949,0:01:01.829
you are given the options of the files

0:00:59.370,0:01:03.600
that you can download. In our case we are

0:01:01.829,0:01:06.210
on Linux so we're going to download

0:01:03.600,0:01:10.729
this one. We're going to click on this

0:01:06.210,0:01:15.360
link for Qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.10.1.

0:01:10.729,0:01:18.360
And we're going to be given a

0:01:15.360,0:01:20.970
window to confirm that we want to

0:01:18.360,0:01:25.350
download the file. We're going to click

0:01:20.970,0:01:28.350
OK and confirm that. And our download is

0:01:25.350,0:01:30.360
going to start. Because I have it already

0:01:28.350,0:01:34.770
downloaded to save time, I'm going to

0:01:30.360,0:01:38.250
cancel out of this and open the terminal

0:01:34.770,0:01:43.439
on my Linux machine. Today I'm going to

0:01:38.250,0:01:46.560
show the directory I'm in by typing pwd.

0:01:43.439,0:01:49.350
And you see that I am in my home

0:01:46.560,0:01:54.689
directory. So I can see the into my

0:01:49.350,0:01:57.210
download folder and do an ls to show the

0:01:54.689,0:02:03.420
files in here. And you see my downloaded

0:01:57.210,0:02:06.090
file. You can hit ls -alh to show the

0:02:03.420,0:02:09.000
files in the folder and other pieces of

0:02:06.090,0:02:11.760
information on the file. You can see the

0:02:09.000,0:02:13.890
size of the file, you see the name of the

0:02:11.760,0:02:16.500
file, you see the

0:02:13.890,0:02:19.800
emissions to the file. Now you see that

0:02:16.500,0:02:22.590
this file is not executable we want to

0:02:19.800,0:02:29.670
make it executable. And we do that by

0:02:22.590,0:02:32.250
typing chmod +x and typing the name

0:02:29.670,0:02:35.550
of the file. You can just type Qt here

0:02:32.250,0:02:38.640
and hit tab to have the name of the file

0:02:35.550,0:02:43.860
also completed. When you done hit enter

0:02:38.640,0:02:45.870
and if we do an ls -alh again you're

0:02:43.860,0:02:48.300
going to see that the file turns green

0:02:45.870,0:02:51.600
and you see the permissions are

0:02:48.300,0:02:54.860
different. Now we have X everywhere which

0:02:51.600,0:02:58.080
means that anybody can run this

0:02:54.860,0:03:02.610
executable file. Now what we're going to

0:02:58.080,0:03:06.090
do is run it ok we hit ./ and

0:03:02.610,0:03:08.489
type the name of the file, hit enter and

0:03:06.090,0:03:12.239
you see that we have the same window we

0:03:08.489,0:03:15.930
had on Windows. Ok, so we're going to do

0:03:12.239,0:03:19.650
the same thing we get to next. And we're

0:03:15.930,0:03:26.970
going to skip out of this Qt account

0:03:19.650,0:03:30.120
then. Next and I want to install Qt in my

0:03:26.970,0:03:34.320
home directory. And we basically choose

0:03:30.120,0:03:38.250
the same things we did in the windows

0:03:34.320,0:03:42.209
install so we want to have the

0:03:38.250,0:03:43.320
components for Qt desktop using the

0:03:42.209,0:03:45.810
GCC compiler.

0:03:43.320,0:03:50.549
I also recommend checking the check

0:03:45.810,0:03:52.769
boxes for android x86 and android arm v7

0:03:50.549,0:03:55.470
because in this course we are going to

0:03:52.769,0:03:58.470
run our applications on Android. We

0:03:55.470,0:04:01.170
mainly need x86 because it makes it very

0:03:58.470,0:04:04.140
fast to run your applications on virtual

0:04:01.170,0:04:06.720
devices but if you happen to have a real

0:04:04.140,0:04:08.940
devices running this architecture, it is

0:04:06.720,0:04:10.709
also going to be useful. So please make

0:04:08.940,0:04:17.660
sure these two check boxes are checked,

0:04:10.709,0:04:21.169
android x86 and android arm v7. Hit next.

0:04:17.660,0:04:26.940
Accept the license.

0:04:21.169,0:04:32.669
Next again and hit install. You can show

0:04:26.940,0:04:38.720
the details about your install and wait

0:04:32.669,0:04:44.780
for it to finish. The install is done now,

0:04:38.720,0:04:51.990
we can click Next and choose to launch

0:04:44.780,0:04:54.630
Qt creator here. Hit finish and we are

0:04:51.990,0:04:58.530
here. The first thing you want to do here

0:04:54.630,0:05:00.660
is to lock Qt creator to launcher so

0:04:58.530,0:05:03.800
that next time you don't have to go look

0:05:00.660,0:05:06.810
for it. Let's maximize this window and

0:05:03.800,0:05:11.330
we're going to try and run a simple

0:05:06.810,0:05:17.220
program as we did for Windows. Hit file -

0:05:11.330,0:05:20.550
new project. We're going to choose a Qt

0:05:17.220,0:05:28.200
widgets application. We're going to call

0:05:20.550,0:05:34.800
it QtCreatorDemo. We choose

0:05:28.200,0:05:38.010
the kit for a project. Hit next. We're

0:05:34.800,0:05:41.700
going to choose few widget as we did for

0:05:38.010,0:05:44.250
Windows. We're going to hit finish and Qt

0:05:41.700,0:05:48.419
creator is going to generate our project.

0:05:44.250,0:05:50.520
And we should see our files in here. The

0:05:48.419,0:05:54.360
first thing you notice here is that we

0:05:50.520,0:05:56.810
really have very small characters in the

0:05:54.360,0:06:03.479
window here. And the way to change this

0:05:56.810,0:06:10.080
you go to tools - options choose text

0:06:03.479,0:06:14.030
editor and increase the size here. We can

0:06:10.080,0:06:20.400
make it 18 I like 18 I think it's good

0:06:14.030,0:06:23.699
so apply hit ok. And you see that things

0:06:20.400,0:06:25.729
are visible right now. So what we're

0:06:23.699,0:06:28.560
going to do is hit the green button here.

0:06:25.729,0:06:31.919
But before we do that let's open the

0:06:28.560,0:06:34.020
compiled output tab here so that we see

0:06:31.919,0:06:39.889
things happening.

0:06:34.020,0:06:39.889
Hit the green button to compile your app.

0:06:41.780,0:06:47.759
Okay and you see that on Linux we have

0:06:45.060,0:06:51.210
an error, our compile actually failed.

0:06:47.759,0:06:56.159
And you see that it says usr/bin/ld

0:06:51.210,0:06:59.639
cannot find -lgl. This is actually a

0:06:56.159,0:07:02.520
problem in Qt finding the things it

0:06:59.639,0:07:04.770
needs to run our app. And a way to fix

0:07:02.520,0:07:07.860
this you have to go to the terminal and

0:07:04.770,0:07:11.069
run a few commands. The commands we need

0:07:07.860,0:07:13.830
to run are shown here sudo apt-get

0:07:11.069,0:07:18.180
install mesa-common-dev and sudo

0:07:13.830,0:07:20.099
apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev.

0:07:18.180,0:07:22.590
So we're going to go there in the

0:07:20.099,0:07:31.400
command line and type this. So we're

0:07:22.590,0:07:40.370
going to open our command line

0:07:31.400,0:07:47.849
sudo apt-geti nstall mesa-common-dev. I put in my password

0:07:40.370,0:07:51.529
you should put in yours. And I'm going to

0:07:47.849,0:07:51.529
agree to install this.

0:07:57.800,0:08:17.840
This is done in sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev.

0:08:21.229,0:08:31.740
We're going to accept to install this

0:08:24.419,0:08:38.510
thing. Okay this is done. Now if you go

0:08:31.740,0:08:38.510
back to Qt creator and run the app again.

0:08:41.300,0:08:46.710
We should be running without a problem.

0:08:44.610,0:08:50.340
And we have our widget application here.

0:08:46.710,0:08:54.839
And now it's not very visible on Linux

0:08:50.340,0:08:58.350
here so let's go to the widgetUI file

0:08:54.839,0:09:01.140
here, double click on it. And put

0:08:58.350,0:09:04.410
something on the screen, let's just grab

0:09:01.140,0:09:09.960
a button just two buttons put them on

0:09:04.410,0:09:15.570
the screen and run again. So we want to

0:09:09.960,0:09:17.850
save what we did, save all. And our app is

0:09:15.570,0:09:21.870
here you see our two buttons. And this

0:09:17.850,0:09:24.330
concludes our install on Linux of Qt

0:09:21.870,0:09:27.150
creator. Okay now that you have it

0:09:24.330,0:09:30.300
running on Linux I'd like to show you

0:09:27.150,0:09:32.880
how to do it on Mac OS but I don't have

0:09:30.300,0:09:37.620
a Mac. And the only thing I can do now is

0:09:32.880,0:09:40.200
a visit web link that works you through

0:09:37.620,0:09:43.110
the process of installing Qt creator

0:09:40.200,0:09:45.930
on a Mac. So if you are on a Mac this

0:09:43.110,0:09:50.400
should be straight forward so we're going

0:09:45.930,0:10:01.589
to copy this come back to our browser

0:09:50.400,0:10:03.470
and go there. Okay, so they say that the

0:10:01.589,0:10:07.110
first thing you have to do is install

0:10:03.470,0:10:09.600
Xcode. And to install Xcode you have to

0:10:07.110,0:10:14.040
go to this link here, click on the view

0:10:09.600,0:10:15.750
in the Mac App Store button and download

0:10:14.040,0:10:18.360
Xcode. You should follow these

0:10:15.750,0:10:22.170
instructions here. And once you have

0:10:18.360,0:10:24.180
Xcode installed you can then install Qt

0:10:22.170,0:10:27.839
creator. You have to install Xcode

0:10:24.180,0:10:30.300
because the tools that are used to

0:10:27.839,0:10:32.670
compile your app are come from Xcode.

0:10:30.300,0:10:35.690
They are bundled into Xcode and there is

0:10:32.670,0:10:37.950
no other way to install them separately.

0:10:35.690,0:10:40.560
After you have Xcode you're going to

0:10:37.950,0:10:43.800
install Qt creator. You go to the

0:10:40.560,0:10:46.740
download link here and you choose to

0:10:43.800,0:10:48.990
download for the Mac and you install it

0:10:46.740,0:10:50.180
as you see here. These are the things we

0:10:48.990,0:10:52.190
just did.

0:10:50.180,0:10:54.770
And after you install it you should be

0:10:52.190,0:10:57.110
able to create a project and run it as

0:10:54.770,0:10:59.600
we did. If you face any problem doing

0:10:57.110,0:11:03.050
this on a Mac please ping me and I'll

0:10:59.600,0:11:06.110
try and help you get across this. And

0:11:03.050,0:11:09.230
this closes our tour of installing Qt

0:11:06.110,0:11:10.370
creator on your platform of choice. In

0:11:09.230,0:11:12.649
the next lecture

0:11:10.370,0:11:15.860
we'd like to look at the user interface

0:11:12.649,0:11:18.020
of Qt creator and try to get more

0:11:15.860,0:11:20.410
familiar with that. I'll see you in the

0:11:18.020,0:11:20.410
next lecture.
