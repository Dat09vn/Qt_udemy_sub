1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
In this lecture we are going to build

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,680
our first qml application and run it in

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
Qt creator. And along the way we're going

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,260
to see some tips to go by when building

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,690
your Qt applications when using Qt quick.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,619
Let's head to Qt creator and do that.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,390
Okay here we are in Qt creator, we're

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,949
going to create a new project. We're

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,850
going to go to file - new file or project.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,470
We're going to choose application. And we

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,830
are going to choose Qt quick application.

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,270
We want to start with this empty

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,989
template so we're going to click on it,

14
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,469
choose next we are going to call it QtQuickAppDemo.

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,200
We want to use this as

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,180
the default project location. We hit next

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,739
you want to use the latest version of

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,190
Qt you have installed. Mine is 5.11

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,750
right now. Hit next you are going to

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,000
choose the kit you are going to use for

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,820
your project. In our case we want to

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,159
develop for desktop. I am going to show

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,750
you how to run your Qt quick

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,240
applications on mobile devices on the

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,119
Android platform later. But for now we choose

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,920
was desktop because we just want to get

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
started. Hit next and hit finish. The

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,970
first thing I want to do is to go

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,250
through the files that are generated for

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,439
us. And go through them to show some of

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,710
the things they can help us with. The first

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,200
one is the project file if you have

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,479
worked with Qt before you know that

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,640
this is the file that ties all your

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
files in the project together.

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,110
It shows what files are in your project

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,909
for now you see that we have a source

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,450
file of main.cpp which is a C++ file. And

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,720
we have another file that contains our

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,689
resources which is called qml that Qt

41
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,090
assists. We're going to ignore this

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,040
things down below here for the moment.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,710
And if you look at the files that we

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,259
have on the left here you see that we

45
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,899
have a sources folder, inside we have the

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,869
main CPP file. And if you open it you see

47
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,500
that it is a C++ file even if we are

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,020
going to be working with Qt quick, Qt

49
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,930
quick works

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,140
with C++ behind the scenes and it needs

51
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,900
a way to run. And we use this thing

52
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,569
called QmlApplicationEngine here to

53
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,079
load our qml file that we show when we

54
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,730
run the application. We're going to run

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,909
it in a moment but I just want you to

56
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,709
have a feel of what is available in your

57
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,230
project. If you look down here we have

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,290
another folder called resources, this is

59
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,689
the folder that is going to contain the

60
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,299
files that your application is going to

61
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,299
need. They are wrapped in resources here

62
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,930
because resources are bundled into the

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,000
executable of your application when you

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,439
distribute it to the user,

65
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,989
making sure that the files that are

66
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,209
critical for your application to run are

67
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,519
always available. Inside the resource

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,459
files we had this main.qml and this is

69
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,349
the main of the code and this is where

70
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,480
we're going to spend most of our time in

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,540
the course. Ok so this is what qml code

72
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,329
looks like. Ok now that we know what is

73
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,519
available in this project let's run the

74
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,129
application. And this is what we have a

75
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,889
boring window that called hello world in

76
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,129
the title. This is your minimal qml

77
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,889
application let's do something a little

78
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,959
bit interesting inside so that we don't

79
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,879
have an empty window. So we're going to

80
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,459
write Text and this creates a text

81
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,220
component inside our window here. So

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,849
we're going to give it the text to show

83
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:48,310
let's say: Hello World. We want it to be in

84
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,680
the middle the window so the way we do

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,939
that we say anchors.centerIn: parent. I

86
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,919
don't expect you to understand

87
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,479
everything right now I just want you to

88
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,489
have something to show in the window. And

89
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,590
I'm going to get a chance to explain all

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,259
these things in the course. Ok so we want

91
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,629
to set the color for the text. I want to

92
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:12,269
make it red for example. And I want to

93
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,310
make the font a little bit bigger so I'm

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,728
going to say font.pointSize let's make

95
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,480
it 20.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Let's run the application. And you see

97
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,590
that in the middle we have a text that

98
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,220
says Hello World. This is what qml code

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,230
looks like you have some imports on the

100
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,180
top here to import some components that

101
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,460
you're going to use. This is where all

102
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,290
these components are coming from, the

103
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,870
text is coming from, the Qt quick window

104
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,510
is coming from, Qt quick window here. And

105
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,160
if you don't believe me let's comment

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,650
this out. And you're going to see that

107
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,470
we're going to have errors. It doesn't

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,750
know what these things are windows, text.

109
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,550
We don't know what these things are so

110
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,070
we need to import this things so that

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,550
our compiler knows what they are. Okay by

112
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,950
now you have seen one way to run your Qt

113
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,590
quick application which is through the

114
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,170
qml application engine class. Let's go

115
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,600
back to Qt creator and analyze this a

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,150
little bit more. If you look in our main

117
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,820
CPP file you see that we have a main

118
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,490
function which is the entry point for

119
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,100
our application. When our application

120
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,920
runs it starts here in the main function.

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,160
We instantiate app GuiApplications like

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,950
that which is going to wrap around our

123
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,170
application. And inside we create a qml

124
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,020
application engine object which we use

125
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,800
here to load our qml file. This line here

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,830
is really loading our qml file and

127
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,010
showing it in the window as we saw when

128
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,470
we run the application. The second way is

129
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,800
to use some provided command line tools

130
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,860
that you can use to run your qml files

131
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,950
one by one. You obviously don't want to

132
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,960
start the Qt project whenever you have

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,120
some qml file you want to run just to

134
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,370
see how it looks. So we're going to use

135
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,740
some of these tools. The first thing you

136
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,260
might ask where do I find these tools.

137
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,780
Well you go where you installed your Qt

138
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,210
packages, in our case we are going to go

139
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,490
in C because that's where I have it

140
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,700
installed. You see I have a Qt folder Qt5.11.1.

141
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,200
I click on the mingw version of my

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,210
Qt installation. I go into the bin

143
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,510
directory. And if I scroll down you're

144
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,000
going to see that I am going to see one

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,650
tool called QML

146
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,500
and another tool called qmlscene. These

147
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,259
are our tools that we can use to run the

148
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,810
application. Okay so what I'm going to do,

149
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,910
I'm going to copy the path to these

150
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,780
tools and I am going to go where my qml

151
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,050
file is located. So I'm going to 

152
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,690
show this in explorer. So if you are on a Mac

153
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,460
or on a Linux machine

154
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,229
you should find equivalent ways to do

155
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,449
the same thing. This just takes me where

156
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,150
my project is hosted. I'm going to hold

157
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,460
down the shift key and right-click and

158
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,520
it's going to give me an option to open

159
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,460
the command line window here. Okay and

160
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,340
you see that it is opened here. If I do a

161
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,979
dir I'm going to see the files that

162
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,320
make up my project and if you look

163
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,810
inside you see that I have a main.qml

164
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,530
file. So what I want to do is to paste in

165
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,210
the path where I have my QML tools in

166
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,599
the Qt installation directory and I'm

167
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,090
going to complete the path with the qml

168
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,520
tool. And I'm going to specify that I

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,750
want to run the main.qml file. Ok

170
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,260
when I hit enter notice what happens you

171
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,210
see that what hello world application is

172
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,789
shown. Okay this is one way you can run

173
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,699
your qml files. Let's use the qmlscene

174
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,090
tool and do the same thing. So I'm going

175
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,449
to say here now scene and I'm going to

176
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,909
specify main.qml as we did before.

177
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,120
And you're going to see that it is the

178
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,220
same thing we have our qml

179
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,430
application running the same way it ran

180
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,580
in Qt creator. If you like me you

181
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,740
probably think that typing all this thing

182
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,900
to run one qml file is really tedious

183
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,810
and it's hard to do. But there is a way

184
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,050
you can add the path to these qml tools

185
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,960
to your environment variables and all

186
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,950
you have to do is do something like qml main.qml

187
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,000
. And it is going

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,760
to run. Why is it running if you do this

189
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,610
it's probably not going to run. For me it

190
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,470
is working because I have added this

191
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,290
path to

192
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,149
environment variables and I'm going to

193
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,040
show you how to do it on Windows.

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,259
There are equivalent way to do the same

195
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,079
on a Linux machine in the Mac. All you

196
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,779
have to do is find ways to add

197
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,610
environment variables to your operating

198
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,279
system and Google should give you more

199
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,730
options than anybody can. So we are going

200
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,569
to go in my computer, click on properties,

201
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:16,470
click on advanced system settings, go

202
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,839
into environment variables. And you're

203
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,880
going to find the path variable like

204
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,069
this you click on it. And you are going

205
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:31,079
to add the path to the tools as I did

206
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,000
here. You can see the full path to there

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,579
and when you add it like this and

208
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:38,149
remember to put a column at the end.

209
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,300
Confirm, confirm, and close this. And if

210
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,399
you close your command line and open it

211
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,069
again just like this you're going to be

212
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,220
able to run your tool so let's clear. So

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,620
I want to kill this application because

214
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,990
there is hang in here. So I want to clear

215
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,040
and show you that I can do the same

216
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,639
thing using qmlscene main.qml. And

217
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,339
you see that the application is running.

218
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,649
There is another way you can run your

219
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,410
QML files if you really don't like these

220
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,930
command-line tools it really is a

221
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,110
wrapper around the qmlscene tool. You

222
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,540
create a prototype file in Qt creator

223
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,000
and run it. Let's go to Qt creator

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,519
and try this tune. The first thing I want

225
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,060
to do is to copy my files because I'm

226
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,350
going to paste it somewhere. Let's

227
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,370
collapse this, save everything and close

228
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,560
again. So I'm going to file - new other

229
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,209
project and on the right here you're

230
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,970
going to see a Qt quick UI prototype. I

231
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,480
want you to select this - hit next. We

232
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,529
call this PrototypeTest. You can choose

233
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,420
where you want to save it on your drives

234
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,270
going to hit next, choose

235
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,520
the latest version of Qt have

236
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,060
installed. And in the end you see that

237
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,710
you have a qml file that is called

238
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,420
PrototypeTest. It takes the name of the

239
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,520
project you specified. So I'm going to

240
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,890
take out everything and paste in the

241
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,370
code we had and I can run it directly.

242
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,920
Okay and you see that it is the same

243
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,150
thing we had before.

244
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,720
And what this is really doing it is

245
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,150
doing the calling to qmlscene for you.

246
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,190
And by now we have seen four ways you

247
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,130
can run your qml files: you can use

248
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,890
QmlApplicationEngine like we did here, you

249
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,620
can use the command line tools that are

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,290
provided, you can call kml scene to run

251
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,810
your application or you can even call

252
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,830
qml to run your qml file and the last

253
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,310
one is to create a prototype file that

254
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,110
you can run directly by clicking the

255
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,240
green button here if that's what you

256
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,930
find easy. Before we wrap up this video I

257
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,270
want to show you how you can show some

258
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,950
log messages because that's something

259
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,130
very important to know in whatever

260
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,800
technology of programming that you are

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
working on. We are going to load

262
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,330
something when our component here is

263
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,340
loaded. The way you do that you say

264
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,240
component.oncompleted. Again don't worry

265
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
if you don't understand all this I'm

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,750
going to have a chance to explain this. I

267
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,060
just want you to know that you can do a

268
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,070
console.log just like in JavaScript to

269
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,400
show some debug messages. So in here we

270
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,670
can say for example component loaded

271
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,750
and when you run the application you're

272
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,250
going to see that in the application

273
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,730
output pane. This covers all we set up to

274
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,440
do in this lecture. I hope you like the

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,110
introduction to Qt quick. And you had in

276
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,000
your arms on different ways you can run

277
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,460
your QML file. In the next section we're

278
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,350
going to start looking at some qml

279
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,750
syntax and shed some light on some of the

280
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,490
things we've been talking about in this

281
00:13:01,490 --> 00:00:00,000
lecture. I'll see you in the next section.
