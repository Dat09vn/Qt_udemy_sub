1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
In this lecture we're going to download

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,899
the tools were going to need in this

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,420
course. We're going to download the Qt

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,910
framework itself and we were also going

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,030
to download QT creator the IDE we're

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,219
going to be using. We're going to get our

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,410
tools from this link here so we're going

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,170
to go there in our browser. And here we

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,840
are. One might want to go directly to the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,269
qt website and try to click on this

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,369
download button. But they do take you

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,949
through a number of steps that I'm not

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,349
willing to go through right now. So let's

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,200
go directly to the download page, click

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,590
on official releases here and we click

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,410
on the qt and we are shown the

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,629
versions that are available for a qt

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,190
here. We're going to choose the latest

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,629
version, which is at the moment 5.10 so

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,020
we go in there. And we choose 5.10.1.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,079
In here we see a number of versions

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,230
we can choose from. We see QT versions

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,500
for Windows, we can choose a QT version

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,949
for Linux and a QT version for a Mac. I

25
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,439
am on a Windows machine right now I'm

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,640
going to choose this one:

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,600
QT-opensource-windows-x86-5.10.1.exe.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,939
I'll click on it and I am

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,040
given this window to confirm that I want

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,640
to download it, so I click save file and

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,909
my download starts here. I already have

32
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,460
the file downloaded to save time so I'm

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,040
going to cancel out of this. You should

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,140
download it if you don't have qt

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,750
downloaded already. And I'm going to open

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,990
the folder where I have it downloaded.

37
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm going to double click on it and they

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,759
tell you to open a qt account and

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,280
things like that. We're not going to go

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,860
through this click Next and right now we

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,320
don't want to open a QT account so skip.

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,680
Hit next and you are given an option to

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,540
choose where you want to install qt.

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,390
Mine is going to be installed in "C:\Qt\Qt5.10.1".

45
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,000
You can choose a location

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,008
you like or you can leave the

47
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,530
if that's okay with you. We're going to

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,659
click Next. So I have installed this

49
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,370
before but you're not going to have this

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,950
error, so I'm going to continue. On this

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,170
screen you can choose the tools that you

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,110
want to install we want to install QT

53
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,290
creator so we selected here under tools

54
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,099
and we're going to install the QT

55
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,299
pre-built components for mingw. I choose

56
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,640
mingw because it's a free compiler so

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,799
it's freely available anywhere on

58
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,769
Windows, Mac and Linux. And we're going to

59
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,840
be using it. On Windows you should also

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,849
know that you can use microsoft visual

61
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,639
studio compiler, we're not going to

62
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,129
choose it here but you can choose it if

63
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,129
you have this IDE from Microsoft

64
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:56,909
installed.

65
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,069
I also recommend checking the check

66
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,810
boxes for android x86 and android arm v7

67
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,030
because in this course we are going to

68
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,879
run our applications on Android. We

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,879
mainly need x86 because it makes it very

70
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,579
fast to run your applications on virtual

71
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,549
devices but if you happen to have a real

72
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,250
devices running this architecture it is

73
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,169
also going to be useful. So please make

74
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,180
sure these two check boxes are checked

75
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,459
android x86 and android arm v7. We're

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,209
going to hit next and we are given an

77
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,879
option to accept the license or deny it.

78
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,049
So we're going to accept

79
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,889
hit next and we're going to start our

80
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,430
installation. You can click on show

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,340
details here and they're going to show

82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,650
you the progress of your install. Okay

83
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,840
our download is done right now and you

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,970
can see the result of our download. They

85
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,870
say that QT has been installed, they tell

86
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,760
us the location where it is installed

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,579
and where we can see the change log for

88
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,530
that. Okay so we hit next and we choose

89
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,589
to launch QT creator but let's not launch

90
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,889
it right now. We're going to close this. I

91
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,630
want you to see where it is installed

92
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,639
and how to start it just in case you

93
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,069
have some down.

94
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,080
So you click on start here and they

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,150
showed QT creator here but we're not

96
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,490
going to click that either. So you go

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,199
down we find QT 5.10.1 and we can click

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,990
on it. You can see that I have qt 5.5

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,300
installed, I have some projects that

100
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,789
are using it but you can have multiple

101
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,789
versions of qt installed so you should

102
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,240
know that. So we'd like to go in here

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,410
click on QT creator 4.5.1 and

104
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,940
open it. Ok here is QT creator opened

105
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,039
ready for you to use. If you look on the

106
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,440
left here we have a few tabs and you can

107
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,900
click around and see things. We're going

108
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,319
to explain the UI of QT creator in an

109
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,569
upcoming lecture. What we're going to do

110
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,729
is create one graphical user interface

111
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,130
project so that you see what QT creator

112
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,520
is capable of. So hit file - new project, we

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,490
choose QT widgets application. You have

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,080
to choose where you want to put your

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,509
project. In my case I want to put it in

116
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,669
D:\OnlineCourses\3.Qt gui\CourseCode and call it

117
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:47,460
1-2QtcreatorDemo. I hit next.

118
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,069
I choose widget application. You don't

119
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,560
have to don't worry if you don't

120
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,210
understand all of this I'm going to

121
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,000
explain this in upcoming lectures. For

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,069
now I just want you to be able to run

123
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,289
something for the first time

124
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,940
in qtcreator. hit next next again and finish.

125
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,789
Ok our project is generated and this is

126
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,870
what the QT C++ project looks like. For

127
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,490
now you don't need to look at the code

128
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,630
all you have to do is click on this

129
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,150
green button to run your project and

130
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,900
make sure it works. You can click on this

131
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,089
tab here down compiled output to see the

132
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,240
progress of how you

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,750
application is being worked. And you see

134
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,520
that they say that the process of

135
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,130
building our application exceeded

136
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,380
normally. So we can see our app here and

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,080
now this is not very exciting but for

138
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,910
now you know that your tools are working

139
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,630
and we can start building QT applications.

140
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,370
And we're going to learn the building

141
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,940
blocks of how you do that in the

142
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,220
reminder of this course. Okay that's all

143
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,410
I had to say in this lecture you have QT

144
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,750
creator installed you run your first

145
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,120
project. In the next lecture we're going

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,220
to look at the user interface of QT

147
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,800
creator and try to explain it a little

148
00:07:19,800 --> 00:00:00,000
bit more. I'll see you there.
