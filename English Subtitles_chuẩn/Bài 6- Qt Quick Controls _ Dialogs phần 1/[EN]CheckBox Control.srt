1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,400
the checkbox QT Quick Controls element.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,589
you use this element when you want to

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,530
select among multiple options. Let's go

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,450
to Qt createor and play with that.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,420
Here we are in Qt creator, we are

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,910
going to create a new project. It is a QT

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,939
quick application, we call it check box

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,350
demo. Choose the QT version we have

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,930
installed, choose our toolkits of

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,610
interest, Android and desktop, and finish.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,200
We want to import Qt quick controls, and

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,170
change the title here to say... checkbox

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,660
demo. Inside here we want to put a column

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,239
component... because we want to lay things

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,180
out from top to bottom. Inside we want to

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,960
put three checkbox elements. This is

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,789
going to say option one. We're going to

19
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:10,189
copy these two times option two, option

20
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:16,220
three. We want to put the spacing of 20...

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,500
between these elements, and we want to

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,900
center this and the parent. We're going

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,869
to say anchors, horizontal, center,

24
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:33,780
parent, horizontal, center. Let's run this and see how it

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,670
looks.

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,979
mm-hmm we have three check boxes here.

27
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,900
You see that you can check them and

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,689
uncheck them. What I want you to see is how

29
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,030
to capture the check state... if you need

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,280
it in your application. This is the

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
natural fence to want from this control,

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,310
right? But before we do that I want you

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,890
to see that you can control the check

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,909
state here. You can say check and set

35
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,170
this to true, for example, and set the

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,139
third one to false.

37
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,020
If we run again, the first one is going

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,690
to be checked and the third one is going

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,630
to be unchecked, which is the default

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,150
setting for these controls. Another thing

41
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,700
you can do is disable one of this, so you

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,290
can set the enabled property to false.

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,700
Okay, it is enabled by default. Let's run

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,000
this. Option 3 is going to be unchecked

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,240
and disabled. You cannot click on it now.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,110
So how do we capture the choice of the

47
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,330
user? How do you know when one is checked

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,209
and is unchecked? You can capture the

49
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,560
uncheck state changed signal... and check

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,020
if it is checked. So you're going to say

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:04,709
if checked equals to Troue, console.log

52
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:16,120
option 1 is checked, and if it isn't we

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:27,580
say that, ok, you can capture this in your

54
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,860
application. And you can do whatever you

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,760
want with this piece of information.

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,670
Let's run the application when we check

57
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,230
on one. Ok,

58
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,290
one is unchecked. One is checked and you

59
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,000
can do the same thing on all these

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,820
checkboxes here. This is really all there

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,430
is to use the checkbox element. If you

62
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,350
need to know more about it you can come

63
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,260
to the help here, and type it in, and see

64
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,260
its information. Or you can select it

65
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,320
here, hit F1. You see that the

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,780
documentation opens up on the right here.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,480
And you can come to the top, click on

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,180
open in help mode, and have the help

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,450
available to you to try out. These covers

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,459
all we have to say about the checkbox

71
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,860
element. In the next lecture, we are going

72
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,500
to look at the combo box, a Qt quick

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:00:00,000
control element. I'll see you there
