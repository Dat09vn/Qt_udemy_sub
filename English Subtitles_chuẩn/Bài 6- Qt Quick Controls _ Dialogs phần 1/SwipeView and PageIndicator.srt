1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,829
in this lecture we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,609
swipe view and page indicator controls

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:07,020
we're basically going to let the user

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,870
swipe through pages to select one page

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,570
or another and on the UI we are going to

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,309
put the page indicator to let the user

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,220
know which page they are at and all of

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,289
the user to navigate quickly to one

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,080
specific page let's go to Qt creator

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,900
and play with us okay here we are we are

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,390
going to create a new project

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,019
it's a Qt Quick application we call it

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,950
swipe view page indicator demo hit next

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,420
choose our QT version and we want to

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,790
choose the desktop Kit I recommend

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,040
running this on Android because this

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,379
project is a little bit fun but if you

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,910
don't have your virtual device around

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,550
you can only run on desktop that's fine

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,530
too hip next we are going to change this

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,910
title I think this is a good time to go

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,160
to the documentation and look at these

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,949
components we're going to type page

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,000
indicator ok you see that this is a

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,540
QtQuick control component and it gives

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,520
you things like that in this case we are

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,150
at page three and you see that the dot

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
is not like the others it is black while

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,960
the others are gray this is what this

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,729
control does and this is how you really

31
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,070
use it you can use it with multiple

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,710
components this is how you define your

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,960
page indicator we're going to play with

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,590
us in a minute and if we look at this

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,750
wipe if you control it also comes from

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,560
QT quick controls and it allows you to

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,950
navigate through pages okay so what

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,680
we're going to do is import QT quick

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,250
controls

40
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,189
they are 2.4 version and down here 

41
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,590
we're going to put a SwipeView control

42
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:17,300
want to give it an id and we want it

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,680
to fill the parent, At the bottom of this

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,660
right view we want to put a page

45
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,709
indicator component you want to give it

46
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:33,049
an ID and we want to stick it to the

47
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,569
bottom of the window we're going to say

48
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:43,069
anchor is bottom parent bottom and we

49
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,670
are going to put a bunch of properties

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,250
that are specific to the page indicator

51
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,260
the first one is going to be current

52
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,319
index we wanted to know which page it is

53
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
at and the way you do that you give it

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,750
the current index for the SwipeView

55
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,390
would like to say SwipeView current

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,079
index because this SwideView has this

57
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,090
property too if you look there and go up

58
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,370
you're going to see that this container

59
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,579
inherits container and if we go to the

60
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,459
container component we're going to have

61
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,190
current index okay so this property is

62
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,389
available to us in the swipe view and

63
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:29,720
page indicator components we want these

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,069
to be interactive

65
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,019
we want the user to be able to click it

66
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,079
we need to tell it how many pages it is

67
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,030
dealing with and the way you do that you

68
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,060
use the count property and the count is

69
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,880
the same as the count in the swipe view

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,160
component so we're going to say

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,359
swipeViewId.count, we also need to swipeView

72
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,329
note the current index so

73
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,150
we're going to say current index equals

74
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,230
page indicator ID current index okay

75
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,079
they take data from each other so the

76
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,209
result of this is going to be that if

77
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,759
the user changes the current page from

78
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,000
the SwipeView then

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,910
the page indicator is going to know

80
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,310
and if you change the current page from

81
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,470
the page indicator, the SwipeView is

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,899
going to know, now that we have the swipeView

83
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,750
and it's basic properties set up

84
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,060
we need to give it the content to show

85
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,920
because right now it doesn't have

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,050
anything to show to make this a little

87
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,870
bit fun I am going to put in a image

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:44,000
component the source is going to be an

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,250
image from the internet we're going to

90
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,230
start with images from the internet and

91
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,180
then we're going to save them locally so

92
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,890
that you can play with this a little boy

93
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:59,300
let's copy this a couple of times say

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,150
image tune here an image 3 I am going to

95
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,450
grab a few images from our website I am

96
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,120
going to go to the blog and choose this

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,120
blog entry and I am going to choose

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,680
these images I can use okay so I am

99
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,710
going to select this image and copy

100
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,680
image location we're going to come back

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,710
to QT creator and paste the location of

102
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,510
that image these images are numbered in

103
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,550
increasing order so I'm going to paste

104
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:43,990
here again and say two and three okay

105
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,760
let's run to see what we have we're

106
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,620
going to have a swipe view to the top

107
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,130
and a page indicator to the bottom okay

108
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,870
you see that frame is loading and you

109
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,610
have the image here I like this but our

110
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,820
page indicator is not centered so we

111
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,669
should go back and look at that and see

112
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,280
if we did that no we didn't Center it so

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,800
we're going to say anchor.horizontalCenter

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
is parent.horizontalCenter

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:24,270
just like this run

116
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:30,270
again this is better wait a minute the

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,210
image is going to load it is here we can

118
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,810
swipe left and right to go through the

119
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,380
images we can also select through the

120
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,020
page indicator this is really good I

121
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,170
think this is the most fun application

122
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,300
we've done in this course and I like it

123
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,790
better okay now that we are getting

124
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,040
these images from the Internet

125
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,830
I want to also do the same but get the

126
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,980
images from the resource folder I am

127
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,960
going to comment these source property

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,530
out so that you have the same thing and

129
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,330
you can try to load images from

130
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,450
elsewhere it is going to work I am going

131
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:21,210
to put another source property here okay

132
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,640
the first thing I want to do is to go

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,950
where my project is stored I'm going to

134
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,010
right click on mainl.qml and

135
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,280
choose show in Explorer it's going to

136
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,190
open where my project is stored I'm

137
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,350
going to create the folder inside call

138
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,150
it images I am going to open the folder

139
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,790
and question the images that I have

140
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,640
prepared okay if you look it is the same

141
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,810
images that we had from the internet the

142
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,480
next thing I want to do is to add a new

143
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,520
resource file that is going to contain

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,390
those images so I'm going to go to the

145
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,040
resources folder add new select Qt and

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,410
choose new resource file we've done this

147
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,410
before

148
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,610
it next next we don't want any prefix so

149
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,760
we're going to deselect prefix check

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,270
this out and hit enter and we're going

151
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,750
to add files to this resource file of

152
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,640
ours we're going to select the three

153
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,040
images and when we do that

154
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,410
they became available here we need to

155
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,679
save this come back to our main KML file

156
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,380
and we can say images and you see that

157
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:48,150
they appear ok images to 1d second one

158
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:58,070
and here we say images three dot PNG

159
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,490
let's run again and now you see that the

160
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,660
images are loaded instantly because they

161
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,830
are local ok but it looks the same there

162
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,470
is no visual difference between loading

163
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,020
the image from the internet and loading

164
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,360
it locally I just wanted you to see

165
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
different ways to do the same thing

166
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,470
these covers all I had to say in this

167
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,450
lecture and the next one we're going to

168
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,850
look at the progress bar to the quick

169
00:09:26,850 --> 00:00:00,000
control I see you there
