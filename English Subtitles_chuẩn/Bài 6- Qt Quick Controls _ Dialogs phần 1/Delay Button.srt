1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,670
delay button to to quick control this is

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,429
a control that allows you to kind of

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,120
prevent accidental clicks let's go to QT

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,860
creator and play with us

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,010
here we are in QT creator we are going

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,949
to create a new project as usual it's a

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,039
QT quick application we call it delay

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,529
button demo and save it in the usual

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,240
location in next choose our Qt version

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,160
and choose our kids we change our title

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,829
here to the delay button demo and down

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,190
here we put in a column component we

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:56,719
want to import QT quick controls 2.4

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,969
because that's our version and down here

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,629
we want to put a label that says what

17
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,439
this component does inside I am going to

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,380
put a bunch of properties that I have

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,049
already prepared we have the width that

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,990
is equal to the width of the parent we

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,479
set the wrap mode to wrap to make this

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,479
text wrapped the next line if it happens

23
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,090
to be wider than the available width and

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,759
we make the font a little bit bigger you

25
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,430
probably know all this down here we're

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,290
going to put a delay button control it

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,350
has a lot of similarities to the usual

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,960
button so it has properties like text

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,329
we're going to call this delay button

30
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,590
how creative we also want to put this in

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,030
the center so we're going to say n

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,479
anchor.horizontalCentor parent.horizontalCentor

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,579
and we want to look at

34
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,520
some specific signals from this delay

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,380
button component selected hit f1 going

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,070
to full help mode if you look at the

37
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,200
description for this button it is a

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,090
checkable button that incorporates in

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,890
delay before the button B

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,890
comes checked and the activated signal

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,100
is emitted it basically is designed 

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,500
by default and you have to hold it

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,340
down to activate it and it is activated

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,100
after an event period of time the period

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,010
of time is specified in this delay

46
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,680
property and the progress says how far

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,950
you have progressed in that time we're

48
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,200
going to come back to our code set a

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,690
delay of one second

50
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,600
a thousand milliseconds and we want to

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,790
know when the button becomes activated

52
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,870
so we're going to say on activated you

53
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:05,350
want to console.log and we want to know

54
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,959
the progress as well if we go back to

55
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,239
the documentation you see there's a

56
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,660
progress property here we want to know

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,130
it so we have an automatic signal called

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,560
on progress changed we want to console

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,090
log progress is well dim let's run the

60
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,180
application and see what it looks like

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,489
you see that this stand is not as we

62
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,140
wanted we want this to fill the

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,410
available width but it isn't so we need

64
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,959
to set something we need to set the

65
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,799
width of this column to be equal to the

66
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,750
width of the parent and let's put in

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,560
some spacing if we run again we're

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,070
probably going to see a change and here

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,220
it is if you click on this button you

70
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,650
see that it just shows you some progress

71
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,630
okay the progress is between zero and

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,168
one and if we keep holding it down it

73
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,048
keeps going when it gets to one it says

74
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,149
button activate

75
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:28,380
I can click again and the button is

76
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,430
activated ok we now when the button is

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,370
activated when this signal is fired and

78
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,889
you can see that it is one when

79
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,310
you reach the progress of one ok you can

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,440
use the button like this if this is the

81
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,970
behavior that you want in your

82
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,449
application but a common usage that are

83
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,150
seen for this is to let the user hold

84
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,490
down the button until the button becomes

85
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,190
activated and when it is activated you

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,590
allow the user to click once and then it

87
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,350
becomes deactivate at it again we want to

88
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,080
use some custom JavaScript to have this

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,660
behavior so what we're going to do is

90
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,349
come to the top here and define a custom

91
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:19,410
property we're going to say property you

92
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,650
say activated and we set this to false

93
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,620
we also want to handle the signal when

94
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,580
the button is pressed we want to check

95
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:44,370
and see if the button is active we

96
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:53,699
console log button is clicked in here you

97
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,560
can do whatever you want to do when the

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,770
button is activated and collect and we

99
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,120
set the activated property to false

100
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,500
after we do our crackin so we saying

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,440
false here and when the button becomes

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,919
activated we want to set the activated

103
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,449
property here to true

104
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,889
to make it possible for the user to

105
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,499
click but as long as you click it is

106
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,050
going to become inactive again and the

107
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,569
clerks are not going to be handled

108
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,999
because activated is not going to be

109
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,029
true I hope this makes sense and we are

110
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,789
still going to see our progress as we

111
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:42,099
hold down the button

112
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:46,959
let's run hold down this pen and you see

113
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,300
that when we release the activated

114
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,559
signal is not being fired okay let's

115
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,829
hold it down till the end it says button

116
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,729
is activated but it is not click we

117
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,639
click they say button clicked and the

118
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,339
progress restarts to zero this is really

119
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,829
all there is to the delay button it is

120
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,069
very easy to use in nature but it can

121
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,050
come in handy when you need something

122
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,739
like this

123
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,629
in the next lecture we're going to look

124
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,259
at the dial control in QT quick I'll see

125
00:07:23,259 --> 00:00:00,000
you there
