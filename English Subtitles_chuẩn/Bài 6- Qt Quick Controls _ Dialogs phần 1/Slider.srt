1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,879
slider QT quick control component, it

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,069
basically works the same as the range

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,110
slider that we have looked at in a

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,840
previous lecture but we only have one

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,719
handle with this control let's go to

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,150
Qt Creator and play with that okay

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,039
here we are in Qt creator we're going

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,039
to create a new project it's going to be

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,099
a QT quick application we call it slider

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:35,630
demo save it in the usual location and

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,680
finish we want to import QT quick

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:54,449
controls 2.4, change the title

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,030
here to say slider demo and we want to

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,510
put the Row component here the width is

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,380
going to be the same as the parent and

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,930
we're going to have some space and let's

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,350
do 20 inside we're going to have a

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,610
slider component it's going to start

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,640
from 1 and end at 100 and the value is

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,530
going to be let's do a 40 and we want to

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,369
know when the value changed ok so you're

23
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:44,040
going to say console.log before we run

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,810
we should come to the top and correct

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,740
here I always met this mistake the width

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,820
equals to the width of the parent

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,950
let's run mm-hmm we have a slider here

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,219
and as we move it to the right we

29
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,280
increase in volume and as we move it to

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
the left we decrease in value until we

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,139
reach the minimum value which is the

32
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,989
from value here to make things a little

33
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,780
bit interest

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,000
then I'm going to change this to the

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,340
column and below the slider I'm going to

36
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,860
put a progress bar we have worked with

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,940
this before it is a matter of changes

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,140
this to progress bar okay and when the

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,140
value changes in the slider we want to

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,120
change the value in the progress bar

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,180
okay let's say progress bar ID here

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,350
should start with the lower case letter

43
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,930
we don't want to know when the value

44
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,300
changes in the progress bar we just want

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,120
to see it but when the value changes in

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
the slider we want to change the volume

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,850
in the progress bar so we're going to

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,800
say progress bar ID value equals value

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,670
something like this from 2 and volume

50
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,700
should be like this this is okay if we

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,230
run and move this around you're going to

52
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,230
see that we move this slider and the

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,810
value in the progress bar also changes

54
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,910
and this is really all there is to

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,459
working with the slider but this is not

56
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,459
centered and I want my bars to always be

57
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,410
centered so I'm going to anchor.horizontalCenter

58
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,850
parent.horizontalCenter to

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,609
Center and do the same for the progress

60
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:53,560
bar run again this is better this covers

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,510
all we had to say in this lecture and

62
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,220
the next one we're going to look at

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,290
another Qt Quick control component

64
00:03:59,290 --> 00:00:00,000
and that is switch I see you there
