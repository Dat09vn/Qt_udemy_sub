1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
in this lecture we are playing with the

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,380
flickable component and the scroll bars

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,839
you use Flickable component when you

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,570
have more content than your available

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,269
window area can display and the scroll

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,120
bars are used to show you that you can

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,390
scroll to see more contents, let'go

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,340
to Qt createor and play with us

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,100
here we are in Qt creator we're

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,160
going to create a new project the Qt

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,769
Quick application as usual we call it

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,009
flickable scroll bar demo save it in the

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,850
usual location hit next choose your QT

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,520
version choose your kit and finish we

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,940
want to change the title to say

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,820
flickable and scroll bar demo we want to

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,829
import QT quick controls let's choose

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,070
the latest version we have in our suit

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,219
installation and if we go to the

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,619
documentation and search for flickable

21
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,430
we're going to see that this component

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,130
places its children on a surface that

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,130
can be dragged and flicked okay you can

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,490
basically scroll through more content

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,430
than your window area can display so

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,020
what we're going to do is put the

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:32,420
flickable component inside here and

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,320
inside we want to put a column component

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,920
to have them layout vertically give

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,979
it an ID make it fill the parent and we

31
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,960
want out flickable component here to

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
have the same width as its parent and

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,200
the same height as its parent but we

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,399
want to tell it how much content it is

35
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,409
expected to show and that content is

36
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,509
going to come from this column component

37
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,000
here it's going to depend on the number

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
and size of the items that the

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
column here contains so we should use

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,570
implicit hide here to play it safe we're

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,380
going to say mColumnId and place

42
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,620
implicitHeight, now we should put some content

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,740
inside this column of ours I have a

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,740
rectangle here prepared I'm going to put

45
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,740
it in to save some time it basically is

46
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,170
a rectangle it has a color it has a

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,480
width that is the same as the parent and

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,209
it has a height and inside we have a

49
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,690
text component that says element 1 and

50
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,170
the text color is white so I am basically

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,380
going to copy it and paste it turn a

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,720
couple of times and change the colors to

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,239
have different things okay this is going

54
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,970
to be in blue and it's going to say

55
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:05,200
Element 2 this is going to be yellow

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,540
and it is going to say element 3 this is

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,510
going to be magenta why not and it's

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,209
going to say element 4 and we're going

59
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,730
to keep going until we have a twist 7 of

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,320
this okay I'm going to keep doing it and

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,049
come back when I'm done okay I have a

62
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,230
bunch of rectangles inside this column

63
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,390
if you want to make you things a little

64
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,640
bit more visible you can collapse these

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,170
rectangles like this okay this is better

66
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,810
if you want to know for example the

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,610
number of rectangles that you have

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,760
inside or something like that so we have

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,239
a Flickable component and we have a

70
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,090
bunch of rectangles inside we can run

71
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,299
the application and see how it looks

72
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,820
mm-hm you see we have our rectangles the

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,630
rectangles are bigger than the available

74
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,829
space in height but we can scroll up and

75
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,640
down because we have a flickable

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,380
wrapping around our column component

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,168
this is cool

78
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,668
another thing I want you to see is that

79
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:21,459
you can put scroll bars on this

80
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,070
flickable component to kind of let the

81
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,000
user have

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,490
idea of how much content is still

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,340
available the way you do that you come

84
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,550
back to our code here come to the bottom

85
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,680
of the column component or you can even

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
come to the top it really doesn't matter

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,640
you just have to be in the flickable

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,940
component and say scroll bar vertical

89
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,460
okay and say scroll bar and that create

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,470
a component like this this is an

91
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,860
attached property that adds scrollbar

92
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,440
capabilities to our flickable component

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,020
here okay and you put a scrollbar

94
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,600
component like this you don't need to

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,480
specify anything else you're going to

96
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,210
have scroll bars when you run this

97
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,790
application and you see that if you

98
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,090
scroll you're going to see a scrollbar

99
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,480
to the right here this is cool isn't it

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,880
so whenever you have more content than

101
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,419
your available window area can display

102
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,240
think of the flickable component

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,260
this covers all i had to say in this lecture

104
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,050
about the Flickable component, in the

105
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,550
next one we're going to look at this

106
00:05:33,550 --> 00:00:00,000
slider component I see you there
