00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
In this lecture we are looking at QT

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,309
quick controls. These are a set of QML

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,090
elements that allow you to work

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,610
beautiful user interfaces very fast. With

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,699
QT quick controls, you are enabled

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,730
to work to user interfaces like this. If

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,519
you look here we have radio buttons, we

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,310
have sliders, and we have a button here.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,830
And of course this is a small subset of

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,929
what is available in QT quick controls,

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,050
but you can see that you can apply

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,809
different styles and themes to your user

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,260
interface, to have different looks and

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,960
feels. There is a predefined set of

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,960
styles that you can use in your QT Quick

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,879
controls and they are listed here if you

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,190
are interested. Then before the style is

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,969
what you have, if you don't set any style,

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,000
the fusion style tries to match what we

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,850
see on desktop platforms. Imagine it's the

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,910
style that is customizable with your own

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,650
icons that you put in a special folder

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,040
in your project and they are

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,590
automatically used as your icons. You use

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,540
material style when you want your QT

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,450
quick application to look like an edit

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,820
Android application, and universal style

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,340
is used when you want your QT quick

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,430
application to look like a Microsoft

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,950
native application on mobile devices, or

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,020
this new fluid interfaces you see in

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,560
newer versions of the Microsoft

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,960
operating system. There are two versions

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,020
of QT quick controls you need to be

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,020
aware of. QT quick control one series.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,600
We're targeting desktop devices. They

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,540
were used a long time ago and they are

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,820
on their way of being deprecated. What

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,820
you should use now is QT quick control

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,520
2, which are more performant on mobile

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,259
devices. And if they are performing on

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,170
mobile devices, they should also be

43
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,860
performant on desktop devices. So if you

44
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,920
can use QT quick controls 2. Here we are

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,950
on the online documentation for QT quick

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,640
controls one series. Tou can see that the

47
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,160
module was introduced back in QT 5

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,650
one, and if you scroll down here you see

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,160
the components that we have in QT quick

50
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,010
controls one. We have application window

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,470
that we can use to have a main window

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,040
with menus, status bars and things like

53
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,890
that.

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,840
We have controls like buttons, checkbox,

55
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,300
combo boxes. We're going to look at this

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,820
thing. On this side you see the online

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,100
documentation from QT quick controls 2,

58
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,459
they basically look like QT quick

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,790
controls one series. But in terms of

60
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,130
performance they are very different from

61
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,010
QT Quick control one series, because a lot

62
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,640
of effort has been put into making them

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,920
as less resource hungry as possible. Okay.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,709
To use them you have to import them like

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,989
this. The latest version of QT Quick

66
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:07,530
controls is 2.4, that comes with Q 511.

67
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:10,230
You can see it here. And if you go down

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,030
you see different versions for Qt Quick

69
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:18,420
controls and the matching QT version. So

70
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,049
if you are running QT 5 7 you learn to

71
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,450
have to use QT quick controls 2.0. And as

72
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,340
you go up you see that the version changes.

73
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,140
You can see that there are many things

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,989
you can use, but for now we are

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,780
interested in Qt Quick controls. So if

76
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,670
you click here on Qt Quick controls you

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,739
wait to see a list of elements that are

78
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,930
available to you in QT quick controls 2.

79
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,610
you can see that we basically have the

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,610
same things we had in QT Quick

81
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,030
controls 1 but they are very different,

82
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,180
in the way they look and in the amount

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,730
of resources that they consume on the

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,799
device where they ran. Ok you can click

85
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,769
on any of these elements to know more

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,829
about them. But this chapter is about all

87
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,190
these elements, so we're going to cover a

88
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,930
good number of them in detail. I also

89
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,239
want to show you a little bit more

90
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,959
information about these styles that you

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,140
can use so you can see the default style

92
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,620
looks like this and they say that it is

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,540
a simple and lightweight all-round style

94
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,670
that offers maximum

95
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,100
performance. So if you want to have

96
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,160
maximum performance especially on mobile

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,280
devices you should use this style. Fusion

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,800
style is designed to give you a desktop

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,740
experience. Iit is designed to look like

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,410
desktop platforms. Imagine style is

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,410
designed to be customizable, so you can

102
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,930
define a folder in your project that

103
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,670
contains your icons for your style and

104
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,800
they are going to be picked up

105
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,340
automatically. And if you look here they

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,380
say it is based on image assets, the

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,690
style comes with the default set of

108
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,120
images which can easily be changed by

109
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,550
providing the directory with images

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,010
using the predefined naming convention.

111
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,590
So you can do that if you want to

112
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,960
provide your own icons for your style.

113
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,510
But we're not going to do that in this

114
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,920
course. if you are interested click on

115
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,890
this link and you're going to have

116
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,070
more information on that. Material style

117
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,110
is for Android devices and a key piece

118
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,340
of information here is that it is

119
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,820
resource-hungry.

120
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,830
This style and it is the same as the

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:37,130
universal style that targets Microsoft

122
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,110
universal design guidelines. It is also

123
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,450
resource-hungry the same as material

124
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,760
style. So we are going to have a chance

125
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,820
to look at these styles and how they

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,790
look as we go through the QT Quick

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,400
controls. And we are going to focus on

128
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,710
QT Quick controls 2 because that's

129
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,560
the way forward. You don't really want to

130
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,720
focus on critically controls one because

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,570
they are going to be deprecated pretty

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,790
soon. But if you want to use them the API

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,860
is pretty much the same, all you have to

134
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,040
do is look at the documentation on some

135
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,480
things you need to be careful about. Okay

136
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,580
this brings us to the end of this

137
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,440
lecture, and the next lecture we're going

138
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,810
to start playing with these QT quick

139
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,240
controls, starting with the button

140
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,240
control. I'll see you in the next lecture
