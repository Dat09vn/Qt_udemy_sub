1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
in this lecture we are visiting the dial

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,819
control including quick this control

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,160
basically allows the user to spin around

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,059
a circle like this and choose values

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,230
from a predefined range let's go to QT

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,670
creator and play with us

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
okay here we are in QT creator we are

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,820
going to create our project it's going

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,220
to be a QT quick application as usual

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,640
we're going to call it diode demo save

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,450
it in the usual location it next choose

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,370
your QT version and choose your kit and

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,100
finish we are going to change the title

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,789
here to dial demo and inside we are

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,640
going to put a column component import

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,930
QT quick controls the latest version as

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,590
of now which is 2.4 we want this to have

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,080
the same width as the parent and we want

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,720
to have a spacing of 40 as usual and

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,759
inside we want to put a Label component

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,810
that says what this thing does down here

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,329
we put it dial component and we can go

23
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,210
to the documentation of it to see what

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,689
it is and what it does it is similar to

25
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,780
a traditional dial knob that is found on

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,720
devices such as stereos and industrial

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
equipment it allows the user to specify

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,119
a value within a range it basically

29
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,729
looks like this if we look at the

30
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,579
properties there is a from value and to

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,549
value and other properties that you can

32
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,130
look at if you are interested we're

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,829
going to go back to our code close this

34
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,780
down we want this Center and

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,489
horizontally so we're going to say

36
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,720
anchor.horizontalCenter

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
parent.horizontalCenter we want this

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,290
to start from one and go up to 100 and

39
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,820
we wanted to start at 50 right in the

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,490
middle we also want to know when the

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,770
value changes so we're going to say

42
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,830
on value changed and we are going to

43
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:43,450
console.log value say let's concatenate

44
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,180
this to this later string and say value

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,110
and I notice that we have a typo in here

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,020
so we're going to say parent with

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,960
instead of only saying parent because we

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,560
want this to be the same width as its

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
parent which is this window here if we

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,140
run now we're going to see our knob here

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,270
okay you see that it is right in the

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,180
middle if we try and move it you see

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,140
that the progress is going towards 100

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,170
we reach the top it says 100 and we

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,660
can turn it back ok the user can

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,290
choose a value in between here

57
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,910
another thing I've seen people do a lot

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,209
is if you don't want to have decimal

59
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,970
values here you can turn this value into

60
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,550
integers very easily by using some

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,500
JavaScript functions that are available

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,160
to you you can say math.floor to have it

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,820
rounded to the lowest value so you can

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,170
say math.floor value and if you run

65
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,980
again you're going to see integers you

66
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,230
can also round up by saying math.ciel

67
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,780
something like this run again

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,390
it basically looks the same it is a

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,640
matter of your own choice what you want

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,760
to use depending on your requirements if

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,920
we go back to the documentation there is

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,930
another property I want you to pay

73
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,840
attention to and it is this wrap here

74
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,800
what it does it holds whether the down

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,630
wraps when dragged for example when this

76
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,330
property is set to true dragging the

77
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,090
dial past the to position will

78
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,180
result in the handle being positioned at

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,730
the from position in our case if we go

80
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,490
past 100 it is going to go back to one

81
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,940
if we go past one it's going to go to

82
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,490
100 I personally don't like this

83
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,100
behavior because it confuses the users

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,890
but if you need it it is a matter of

85
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,540
coming here and saying wrap and set this

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:11,590
to true and run the application and if

87
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,160
you go past 100 you see that it comes to

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,340
one you can go up again and if you

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,370
decrease and go past one you see that it

90
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,100
jumps to 100 okay now you know how to

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,500
use the dial control to let the user

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,470
choose a value from a predefined range

93
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,690
in the next lecture we're going to look

94
00:05:31,690 --> 00:00:00,000
at the frame control I'll see you there
