1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,110
you use a frame control when you want to

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,649
have a visual group and of your qml

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,290
components let's go to Qt creator

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,559
and quickly play with this control okay

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,509
here we are we're going to create a new

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,820
project

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,250
it's a QT quick application we call it

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,380
FrameDemo save it in the usual

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,199
location choose our QT version choose

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,510
our kit if you want to run this on

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,910
Android you can choose this kit and use

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,300
it as we have seen before I am NOT going

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,920
to use it now so I uncheck it we are

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,899
going to change this title to frame a

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,120
demo and import our QT quick controls

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,469
2.4 our version I want to have a frame

17
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,059
control inside here inside I want to

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,549
have a column layout you see that column

19
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,130
layout is not recognized can you know

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,610
why we didn't import the layout

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,640
components so we should say QT quick

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,110
layout and I choose one and four as our

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,650
version inside we are going to put three

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,860
buttons this is going to be button one

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,420
to copy

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,880
let's past two times to have three

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,829
buttons button 2 and button 3 and before

28
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,689
we run this application we want this

29
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,210
frame centered in the parent so we're

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,610
going to say Anchorage Center in parent

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,509
and if you run this you wait to have a

32
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,090
rectangle around these buttons this is

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,390
what really this frame control is all

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,690
about giving you a visual representation

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,810
of the group and

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,790
qml components and you can do

37
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,800
normal stuff with your controls for

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,540
example you can handle clicks on these

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,390
buttons or really do whatever you like

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,140
with these buttons let's look at the

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,069
documentation to have an official

42
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,080
statement of what this does so we're

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,800
going to click f1 while having Frame

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,430
selected here let's close this up and

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,940
help in full mode and what it does it is

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,190
used to layout a logical group of

47
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,459
controls together with them a visual

48
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,030
frame ok frame does not provide a

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,850
layouts of its own but requires you to

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,280
position its contents for instance by

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,830
creating your own layout or column

52
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,080
layout which is what we did here and

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,870
this is really all there is to this

54
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,450
frame control in the next lecture we

55
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,970
need to look at group box radio button

56
00:03:07,970 --> 00:00:00,000
and check boxes I'll see you there
