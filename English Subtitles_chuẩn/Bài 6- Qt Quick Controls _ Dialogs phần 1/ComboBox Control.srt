1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
in this lecture we are going to look at

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,120
the combobox

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,640
element it is an element that allows the

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,010
user to choose between different options

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,460
if you come to Qt creator go to

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,210
tools options and choose Build & Run

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,310
here you going to have an option here

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,070
stop application before building I just

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,840
want you to see that a combobox is

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,699
something like this you click on it and

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,980
you are given a few options you can

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,260
choose from and you choose one by

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,279
clicking to it

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,980
let's create a new project QT quick

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,719
application we call it combobox demo

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,610
hit next choose our Qt version we

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,040
want these toolkit we are working on

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,960
desktop in this demo we change the title

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,260
to combo box demo and we should put in

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,840
our import for a QT quick controls

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,188
controls 2.4 that's what we want down

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,810
here we want to put a column element we

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,240
want these spacing to be 40 and we want

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,369
its width to be the same as the parent

25
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,960
in this we put the label element

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,290
and the label element is really like a

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,860
text element if we click on it and press f1

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,390
going to help mode you're going to

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,750
see that the label element extends text

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,750
with styling and font inheritance it

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,960
really is a text that is enhanced with

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,750
more features so you can give it some

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,799
text to show and we are going to say 

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,329
"Non Editable Combo" because this is what we

35
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,040
want to show out mean the combobox that you

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,390
cannot edit we want its wrap mode to be

37
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,239
level wrap we want it to be aligned in

38
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,739
the center so we're going to set

39
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,550
horizontalAlignment

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,810
Qt AlignHCenter and we

41
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,450
wanted to have the same width as its

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,200
parent okay we put the label to keep

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
things organized and so that you can

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,720
know what we are aiming at down here we

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,440
are going to put a combobox element

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,120
okay let's look at its documentation

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,690
click on f1 go in full help mode and

48
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,030
you're going to see it is a combined

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,880
button and pop-up list this is a better

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,640
explanation actually when you click on

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,920
it there is a pop-up list that shows

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,440
with the options that you can choose

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,320
okay and you use it like this the model

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,810
property allows you to give it a list of

55
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,630
things that it can show and we are going

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,360
to Edit, in a moment let's give it an

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,640
ID okay this is the ID we want let's

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,920
close this we want to give it the data

59
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,010
to show using the model property we put

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:25,930
this in an array so let's say 1 2 this

61
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,010
should do we want it to be in the center

62
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,790
horizontally too so we can say anchors

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,550
horizontal center because parent

64
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,470
horizontal Center and we want to know

65
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,320
when somebody selects something in the

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,020
combo box if we go back to the

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,980
documentation and look at its signals

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,040
there is one signal that is called

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,480
activated and it is emitted when the item

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,260
at index is activated by the

71
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,520
user okay so we can say on activated

72
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,750
this is the handler we want and inside

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,239
this handler we want to output the

74
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:15,880
element that was selected and there is

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,918
another property that should give us

76
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,060
that on a plate and that one is current

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,860
text so we can say console.log

78
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,360
we want to put the current index inside

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
square brackets so we're going to do

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:44,900
something like this okay we first want

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,389
to show the index which is current index

82
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,969
this is another property of the combo

83
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,039
box element if you go there you see that

84
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,580
it is this property that holds the index

85
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,819
of the current item in the combo box

86
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,069
okay we are going to append the current

87
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,509
text to show the current element and we

88
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,349
are going to append a string literal

89
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,909
that says is activated okay you going to

90
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:16,819
see what I mean when we run this let's

91
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,289
run the application mm-hmm you see that

92
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,300
when we click on the combo box here we

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,180
have a list of options you can select

94
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,580
one through four for example if we

95
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,830
select three it says to the index and it

96
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,979
says the text and it says is activated

97
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,240
okay the index for 3 is 2 because the

98
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,750
indexes start from 0 so this is 0 1 2

99
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,240
and the last one should be 3mx and it

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
says the text and it says it is

101
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,479
activated

102
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,210
I hope this shows you how you can

103
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,300
capture the currently selected item in

104
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,270
the combo box and another thing that is

105
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,479
not obvious is how you give your combo

106
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,469
box a list of things it can show ok this

107
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,529
is a model property we haven't really

108
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,409
talked about models in qutilat we are

109
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,270
going to talk about that later in the

110
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,569
course but for now know that it is a way

111
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,110
you feed the data to show to the combo

112
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,509
box and this is really what we did here

113
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,360
now you know how to work with a non

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,689
editable combo box that you feed static

115
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,569
data using model property here the

116
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,729
next thing we want to do is to use

117
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,939
an editable combobox that we can add

118
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,509
data to at run time okay we're going to

119
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,059
call this editable it's really going to

120
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,419
be the same the other properties and we

121
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,169
are going to copy these combo box and

122
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,879
give it a bunch of other properties okay

123
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,229
we are going to call it editable combo

124
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,020
because we want to edit it and we want

125
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,479
to set its editable property to true to

126
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,259
make it edible

127
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,059
okay another thing I want you to see now

128
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,550
is that you can feed this with an

129
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,729
explicit model we are going to use a

130
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:30,509
model that we call list model we are

131
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,360
going to give it an ID of model and

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,169
again I haven't really explained models

133
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,080
in QT quick for now I just want you to

134
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,300
have something to show in the combo box

135
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,149
and just look at how I do things here

136
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,819
don't focus on the model stuff

137
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,610
focus on how they feed data to the combo

138
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,159
box okay I'm going to try and explain it

139
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,999
as I go

140
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,180
to save some time I am going to put a

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,319
list of elements inside this model let's

142
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,529
hit ctrl a and control I to align fence

143
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,520
I just put these list elements, this

144
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,069
element is an element that allows you to

145
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,419
add items to the model okay you see that

146
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,020
we have objects inside we have an

147
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,509
attribute of text and an attribute of

148
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,659
location we have a few animals inside we

149
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,149
have a dog chicken cat and meerkat and

150
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,080
the location Kigali Beijing Mumbai and

151
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,179
Paris just look at this as a way to feed

152
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,458
data to the combobox don't focus on the

153
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,279
details of how this works I am going to

154
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,169
have a chance to explain this when we

155
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,660
talk about models and using into the

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,390
Qt quick, because our list element has two

157
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,240
attributes we need to specify which

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,620
attribute is going

159
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,200
to be shown in the list model just like

160
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
we saw one two three in the first combo

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
box here the way you do that you specify

162
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,870
a text role property and you pass in the

163
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,870
name of the attribute that you have in

164
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,150
your model here and this name should be

165
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,670
in quotes don't forget that and by now

166
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,190
if we run the application let's see what

167
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,900
we see mm-hmm you see that our elements

168
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,230
are showing inside we have a dog chicken

169
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,990
cat and meerkat you can see that this

170
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,360
combo box is different from what we had

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,750
before because it allows us to change

172
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,089
the data inside for example if we set

173
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,080
dog111 and hit enter we see that

174
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,110
our data is not added to the model why

175
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,900
is that this is because you didn't

176
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,500
capture the on accepted signal of the

177
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,870
combo box if you go back to the

178
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,459
documentation for the combobox

179
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,570
look at signals the accepted signal is

180
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,330
emitted when the return or Enter key is

181
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,420
pressed on an editable combo box so we

182
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,900
need to capture this signal and manually

183
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,470
add the data to the model and before we

184
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,410
do that I want you to look at another

185
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,360
property which is called edit text which

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,390
contains the text that the user typed in

187
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,260
in the combo box to add to the model we

188
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,959
are going to use these two things let's

189
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:43,230
come down here and set on accepted but

190
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,920
before we add the item to the model here

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,800
we need to check if the combo box

192
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,529
doesn't have this element already for

193
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,959
example if you try to add dog again

194
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,900
while dog is here we should be able to

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,050
detect that and not add it

196
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,060
again the way you do that you use the

197
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,750
method that is provided by ListElement

198
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,050
which is called find okay it is here in

199
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,670
methods this method returns the index of

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,269
the specified text or minus one if no 

201
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:20,810
match is found so what we can do is set

202
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,470
if find

203
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,870
edit text because edit text is the text

204
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,990
that the user typed in the combo box if

205
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,450
we cannot find it in the combo box

206
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,470
already this is going to return minus

207
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,950
one and this is when we want to add the

208
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,779
element to the model so we're going to

209
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,350
set model which is the ID of our model

210
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,769
and set append and we are going to

211
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,470
append an object okay we are going to

212
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:02,810
set text edit text and because of our

213
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,170
model takes two attributes in list

214
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,810
elements we can add a dummy location

215
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:18,230
like location let's say us why not can

216
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,660
we do that let's try this if we run this

217
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,120
okay you see that we have our four

218
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,320
elements if we delete this and set

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,779
Buffalo hit enter and look down again

220
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,120
you see that we have buffalo and if we

221
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,360
select it you see that index 4 has been

222
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,930
added and it is buffalo okay we can

223
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,020
manually add data to our model here

224
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:55,160
let's add giraffe hit enter look down

225
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,050
you see we have buffalo and we have

226
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,540
giraffe the last thing i want to show

227
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,510
you is how you can manually capture the

228
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,940
current element without having to select

229
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,490
another one sometimes you need that

230
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,680
let's go down here and add a button

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,320
you already know how to use a button the

232
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:22,810
text is going to set capture current we

233
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,610
want it to be in the center so we're

234
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,390
going to copy this and put this here and

235
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,060
the one it is clipped we want to capture

236
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,670
the current element and show it in the

237
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,560
debug output so we're going to say

238
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,710
console.log we want to get the text and

239
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,190
the location of the list element here

240
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,460
for the current item that is selected in

241
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,480
the combo box the way you do that you

242
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,430
want to put things in square brackets

243
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:03,160
like this so we want to say inside here

244
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,050
model yet okay this is a method that is

245
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,240
provided by the model it basically

246
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
returns this list element object and

247
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,760
then you can call these properties using

248
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,710
the dot notation I am going to show you

249
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,960
what I mean so I am going to say

250
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,390
editable combo box ID current index okay

251
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,020
when you do this this is going to return

252
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,300
the ListElement that is the currently

253
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,180
selected I am and we can say text to get

254
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,900
its

255
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,860
text we are going to put a column here

256
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,890
and add its location so we're going to

257
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:55,090
say model get all this things and put

258
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,490
this on the next line so that things are

259
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,800
readable a little bit and say location I

260
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,140
hope this makes sense this is a method

261
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,970
for the list model here that gets the

262
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,150
list element at a given index we are

263
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,610
passing the current a text and when we

264
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,810
get the object here we captured the text

265
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,819
by saying dot text here and

266
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:25,100
captured the location by saying that

267
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,229
location we're going to run the

268
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:31,699
application if we click on capture

269
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,879
current element you see that it says

270
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,600
Dog Kigali which is what we have our

271
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,619
dog is located in Kigali let's add our

272
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:48,589
own element and say Buffalo remember

273
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,679
that the elements we add manually are

274
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,350
going to be located in the US by default

275
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,369
which because that's what we did here

276
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:02,299
okay if we say this Buffalo is going to

277
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,309
be added to the list if we get the

278
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:06,679
current element we are having Buffalo

279
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,429
located in the US let's add giraffe it's

280
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:16,579
also going to be in the US okay select

281
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:20,319
chicken it's going to be in Beijing

282
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,649
select giraffe it's going to be in the

283
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,819
US okay it's Giraffe, I

284
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,069
realized this is a bit useless because

285
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:34,429
the location is hard-coded in here but

286
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,549
it is not difficult to get the location

287
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:39,589
from another location in your

288
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,439
application and use it here I just

289
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:45,229
wanted you to have a way to read the

290
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:48,289
data that is stored in a model that you

291
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,289
specified and supposedly to your combo

292
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,720
box here and by now you have all the

293
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,459
information you need to work with the

294
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,729
non editable combo box and an editable

295
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:02,419
combo box okay you can pass in static

296
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,529
data like this or you can pass in an

297
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:09,439
explicit model like this okay don't

298
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,619
forget to set the textRole property for

299
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,599
your model when you do it like this

300
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,909
because when you forget it your combo

301
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,878
box is not going to know what it needs

302
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:23,750
to show in here okay if we comment this

303
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,990
out and run the application we are going

304
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,450
to have an error on the combo box is not

305
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,700
going to know what it needs to show this

306
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,860
is an internal error on the combobox

307
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,049
because it doesn't really know what

308
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:36,290
to show 

309
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,170
you need to set this property to have a

310
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,890
model that you set like this to work

311
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,570
this covers all I have to say in this

312
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,640
lecture in the next one we like to look

313
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,490
at a component called a delay button

314
00:17:49,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there
