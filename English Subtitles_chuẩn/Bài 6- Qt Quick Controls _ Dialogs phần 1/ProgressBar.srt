1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,650
in this lecture we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,140
the progress bar to to quick component

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,210
you use this when you want to show the

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,250
progress of something that is going on

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,309
sometimes it is very similar to the busy

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,410
indicator that we have seen before but

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,130
it also can show specific progress of an

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,990
action if you happen to have the data

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,240
for that we're going to go to QT creator

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,410
and play with us

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,160
okay here we are in Qt creator we're

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,310
going to create our project the Qt Quick

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,650
application we're going to call it

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,739
progress bar demo save it in the usual

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,520
location yet next choose your QT version

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,940
and choose your desktop kit we are going

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,430
to change the title here and say

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:57,059
progress bar demo we want to import QT

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:07,170
quick controls 2.4 and we want

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,380
to lay things out from top to bottom

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,580
we're going to use a column component we

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,350
want it to be the same width as the

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,360
parent and we want some space and let's

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,549
do 20 let's see we'd like to see how

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,150
this looks

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,939
we want to put in a button component the

27
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,740
text is going to say start some action

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,570
and it's going to be in the center

29
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,700
horizontally down we want to input a

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,240
progress bar component we wanted to

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,060
start from one and finish at 100 we give

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,479
it an ID of progress bar and we wanted

33
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,250
to have a volume of 40 so what we want

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,008
to do is that when the user clicks we

35
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,568
want to change the value of this

36
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,239
progress bar to something else I'm going

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,290
to say onClicked

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,069
in the button and we like to do progress

39
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:24,739
bar value let's set this to 78 why not

40
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,629
we also want to Center this progress bar

41
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,129
so we can actually copy this and put it

42
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:40,859
here and run the application mm-hmm if I

43
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:43,079
click you see that the progress changes

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,239
this is one way to change the value in

45
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,389
the progress bar but you can also do

46
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,310
another kind of progress bar that

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,519
doesn't have a specific value to show

48
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,760
okay let's call this progress bar ID 1

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,459
to make it different from this we don't

50
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,370
need to specify from 2 of value

51
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,040
properties but you need to make it in

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,049
the terminal and you do it like this if

53
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,609
we run this we're going to see something

54
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,979
going on like this it basically is the

55
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,810
same as a busy indicator it is just a

56
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,419
different kind of that okay to make

57
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,510
things a little bit interesting and give

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,849
you a chance to do some practice we're

59
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,940
going to put a dial control on top of

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,989
the first progress bar here and what we

61
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,000
can do is basically very easy we change

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,690
this to a dial control let's call this

63
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,549
DialId the inside is not going to

64
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,430
change but when value changes okay we

65
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,379
want to change the value in the progress

66
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,699
bar we're going to say progress bar ID

67
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,560
we want the first one I'd say value

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,060
equals value the value from this dial

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,720
let's run the application

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,949
and you see that as I increase the value

71
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,340
in the progress bar also changes this is

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,250
cool isn't it, this should give you a

73
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,169
good introduction on how you work with

74
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,350
progress bars to show that something is

75
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,600
going on in the next lecture we're going

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,760
to look at another UI component and that

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,130
is range slider

78
00:04:46,130 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there
