1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
in this lecture we are looking at

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,190
another QT quick control component which

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,790
is range slider it basically allows you

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,580
to choose a range specifying the minimum

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,519
value and the maximum value let's go to

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,369
Qt creator and look at this okay

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,189
here we are in QT creator we are going

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,119
to create our new project QT quick

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,670
application it's going to be called

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,939
range slider demo save it in the usual

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,719
location and next choose your tutee

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,300
version your kit and next we want to

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,460
change the title here to range slider

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,700
demo and import our 2.4 quick

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,210
controls module to that form that is but

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,219
before we do anything with this land I

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,410
want to go to the documentation and show

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,140
it to you so we say a range slider

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,950
and if you look at it it is from the QT

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,189
quick controls module what it does it is

21
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,320
used to select the range specified by

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,439
two values by sliding each handle along

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,310
the track

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,070
you basically have something like this

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,710
let's go back to our code put in a row

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,750
component that is going to contain our

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,140
range sliders you want the spacing to

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,240
be 40 and the width is going to be the

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,009
same as for the parent inside we want to

30
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,619
put a range slider we don't wait anymore

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,070
if you go back to the documentation and

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,619
look at its properties you see that you

33
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,649
can specify the first value and the

34
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,930
second value the first value is

35
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,820
basically the starting value for your

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,700
range and the second value is the ending

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,729
value we want to specify a first value

38
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,420
of 25 and the second value

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,000
of 75 after we specify this we also have

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,310
to specify the from and to

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,310
properties because it needs to know the

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,190
range where it is operating okay we're

43
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:28,340
going to say from 1 and to 100 let's run

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,010
and you see our range slider here okay

45
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,140
if you move it you're going to change

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,330
the values for the first component and

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,640
you're going to change the value for the

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,250
second component by dragging this second

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,830
handle here if you need to know the

50
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,260
values as they change you can do

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,170
something like first on value changed

52
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:09,840
and you can counselor okay

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,030
and you can do the same thing for the

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:35,579
second value second let's run mm-hmm you

55
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,260
see that when you first run the

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,190
application

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,410
the signals are emitted okay as you drag

58
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,180
the first handle you're going to see the

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,190
value change okay you can drag it up to

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,180
the second handle you can't go past it

61
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,310
the second handle can be dragged up to

62
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,819
100 the maximum if you drag it down it

63
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,139
can't go past the first handle this is

64
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,810
what this control does if you happen to

65
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,930
need it it is available to you another

66
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,459
thing you should see is that you can

67
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,040
make this vertical okay you can

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,390
basically use the orientation property

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,389
okay and make it vertical

70
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,669
you want it is horizontal by default

71
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:29,419
we're going to copy this and come back

72
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,939
to our code and say orientation and

73
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,539
passing the vertical orientation if we

74
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:43,729
run this our rangerslider is vertical

75
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,860
okay when it is vertical the first

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,699
handle is to the bottom as you can see

77
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,490
here as we drag it we see that the first

78
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,580
value changes to something the second

79
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,840
handle is to the top okay this is weird

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,389
I thought that the first handle should

81
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,330
be to the top and the second one to the

82
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,669
bottom but you can play with us and

83
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,580
organize things as you want okay this is

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,259
all i have to say about the range

85
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,210
slider it is available to you if you

86
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,009
happen to need it in the next lecture

87
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,259
we're going to see how you work with the

88
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,110
flickable component and scrollbars I'll

89
00:05:21,110 --> 00:00:00,000
see you there
