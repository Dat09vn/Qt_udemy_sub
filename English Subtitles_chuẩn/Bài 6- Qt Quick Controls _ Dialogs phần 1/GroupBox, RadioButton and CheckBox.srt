1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
in this lecture we are looking at how

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,100
you can use the group box component to

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,930
group radio buttons and checkboxes

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,870
together let's go to Qt creator and

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,509
play with us, here we are in QT creator

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,590
we are going to create our project

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,930
it's a QT quick application we are

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,439
calling that GroupBoxDemo, saving it in

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,019
the usual location choose our QT version

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,930
and choose our desktop kit, we want to

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,660
change the title here to reflect what we

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,149
are doing inside we want to quote a

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,590
column component set the spacing to 10

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,110
and I wanted to feel the parent we have

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,489
to include QT quick controls so we say

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:08,490
QT quick controls 2.4 and we also put in

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,310
a Label component that says what this

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,520
does okay it's a group box that is going

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,830
to wrap around radio buttons that we're

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,020
going to look at right now we're going

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,229
to put in a group box component it is

22
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,229
going to have a title that says choose

23
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,180
corners we're basically going to let the

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,009
user choose what they want to take a

25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,070
step on us and we want it centered in

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,360
the parent horizontally the group box

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,729
doesn't have a layout system of its own

28
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,130
so you have to layout your own pants

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,590
inside we're going to put a column

30
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,829
component and we're going to say radio

31
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,710
button to put one radio button text is

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,280
going to be cook ok we're going to put a

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,020
bunch of other radio buttons

34
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:22,680
let's say green tea and why not by now

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,590
if we run this application we will have

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,700
three radio buttons laid out vertically

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,140
and in a group box component this group

38
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,620
box is not only visual because it groups

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,380
these radio buttons together allowing

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,920
you to only check one let's run and show

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,200
you what I mean mm-hmm

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
you see that we have our title on top

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,470
and we can only check one check box

44
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,310
inside this group box this is the effect

45
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,799
you usually want with radio buttons to

46
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,280
let the user only choose one thing among

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,890
a list of options that you give them and

48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,650
you can know when one is checked by

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,590
handling the checked signal for example

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,049
let's choose the coke radio button here

51
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,269
we can say on check state changed okay

52
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:30,359
and say if checked equals to true I like

53
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,900
to do it this way because it is more

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,840
understandable and easier to see we say

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:52,730
console.log and if it's not checked

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:03,500
we're going to say it's not checked

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,230
let's run again mm-hmm I check it they

58
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,959
say that the button is checked I click

59
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,320
on another button the cock button is

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,470
unchecked and we know here ok you can

61
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,510
capture all this information in your

62
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,260
handlers if you happen to need that

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,240
this is really all there is to working

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,480
with group box and radio button I am

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,780
going to add another group box that

66
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,070
wraps around checkboxes just to show you

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:46,650
how you can use that and in fact I can

68
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,570
copy this group box to save some type in

69
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,050
let you copy and paste that down here

70
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,250
and I'm going to change this to check

71
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:07,920
box paste paste here we're going to say

72
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,780
choose cute soap or red platform for

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:21,480
example and here we can say Windows Mac

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,340
Linux and let's specify Desktop 

75
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,970
platform here

76
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,100
to be specific okay if we run this

77
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,540
application what shall we see we will

78
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,150
see check boxes down ok a group box

79
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,910
wrapping around check boxes you see the

80
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,760
title here choose support a desktop

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,550
platform and you can choose one okay it

82
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,580
says coke button checked I don't want

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,030
this

84
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:02,550
it should say windows button checked, this

85
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,910
is the evil thing about cookie tasting

86
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:15,030
run again and you can now when the

87
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,450
windows checkbox is checked and I want

88
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,730
to draw your attention to something and

89
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,640
that is that when you group checkboxes

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,910
inside the group box they are not

91
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,100
exclusive you can choose multiple stuff

92
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,220
together like here when we have when

93
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,500
it's much selected but notice that

94
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,580
with radio buttons you can only

95
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,970
one so if you need to have your choices

96
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,090
exclusive use radio buttons if you need

97
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,479
your choices to be not exclusive use

98
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,379
check boxes from the c++ side of Qt it

99
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,370
is possible to make check boxes also

100
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,310
exclusive but from QT quick I still have

101
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,680
to see a way to do that but you probably

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,780
not going to need that because radio

103
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,020
buttons are enough for this purpose okay

104
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,849
this is really all I wanted to show you

105
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,860
about the GroupBox component in the

106
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,509
next lecture we're going to look at the

107
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,940
page indicator component and how you can

108
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,550
use it with this wide view I'll see you

109
00:07:15,550 --> 00:00:00,000
there
