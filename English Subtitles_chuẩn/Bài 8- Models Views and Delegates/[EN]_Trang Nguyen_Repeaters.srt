1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
in this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,990
repeaters. repeaters allow you to show

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,330
your data in a very similar way to the

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,220
way you display the data in the listview,

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,740
but you use it in cases where a

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,710
ListView is not usable. it also gives you

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,540
more control on how you display your

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,240
data. we're going to go to QT creator and

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,090
play with it. okay here we are in QT

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,750
creator, we create our project as usual.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,400
it's going to be called repeaterdemo.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,620
choose our Qt version, choose our kit,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,430
and Finish. we want to say "repeater demo"

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,670
here, and inside we want to put a

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,390
flickable component. and now you are

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,370
wondering why do we put the flickable

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,030
if a repeater is like listview. well a

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,460
repeater doesn't have a bulletin

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,550
flickable like a ListView does. that's

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,800
because it wants to give you more

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,709
control on how you display your data, so

22
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,780
we are going to weld the flickable

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,720
ourselves. so inside we want to put a

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,880
column component, and this is how we are

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,770
going to display our data from top to

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,290
bottom. ID is going to be column, it's going

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,310
to fill the parent, and we want to give

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,869
it a spacing of two. we want to let the

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,880
flickable know how much content it has

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,950
to display, so we're going to say content

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,600
height. we have done this before, and it's

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,869
going to be the height that is to be

33
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,119
displayed in the column here, so we're

34
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,770
going to say implicit height for this,

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,970
but we also wanted to fill the parent, so

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,430
we go back to our column here. inside we

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,090
want to put a repeater, our component of

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,729
interest in this lecture. a repeater is

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,759
very similar to the ListView in that it

40
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,960
has a model property and a delegate

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,979
property to control how each element and

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,890
the repeater is going to look.

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,680
so for example if we say 10 for a model, we

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,750
haven't done this, so let's do this so

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,140
that you see we can specify our model

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,060
like this, you're going to see what is

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,879
going to happen when we run this, and for

48
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,519
our delegate, we want to put in an inline

49
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,920
one, which is going to be a rectangle

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,239
like this. okay so I just pasted this and

51
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,819
to save you some type in time, but it's

52
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,620
nothing you haven't seen before, we have

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,470
a width, a height, a color. we have a text

54
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,510
component inside the delegate. this is

55
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,930
what it is going to look like, and we

56
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,989
want to make it clickable. we also access

57
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,739
the current item for the delegate using

58
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,560
the model data role, which is the same

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,560
thing we have seen in the ListView, and

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,910
listmodel. if we run this application,

61
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,010
we're going to see numbers displayed

62
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,349
from 0 to 10, and the look of each item

63
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,349
is controlled in the delegate here. this

64
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,180
is really how you work with repeaters.

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,489
you see that we don't have complicated

66
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,280
stuff inside, and when we specify our

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,109
model like this, you see that we have

68
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:28,599
numbers from 0 to 9 so you can

69
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,450
understand it as displaying the number

70
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,090
of integer elements you are going to

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,000
show, starting from 0. so we go from 0 to

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,380
9, and total we have 10 elements. we can

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,799
also comment this, and put in the months

74
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,319
like we have been doing in a few

75
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,919
previous lectures, and if we run, it's

76
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:56,620
also going to work the same. ok this is

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,049
what we have, and this is really how you

78
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,200
work with a repeater. that's selected hit

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,260
f1 and go to see what the official

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,049
documentation has to say about it. the

81
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,120
repeater type is used to create a large

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
number of similar items. like other view

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
types a repeater has a model and a

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,738
delegate for each entry in the model. the

85
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,649
delegate is instantiated in a context

86
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,229
seeded with data from the model. so the

87
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,410
data is coming from the

88
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,800
model. a repeater is usually enclosed in

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,750
a position or types such as row and

90
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,170
column to visually position the multiple

91
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,660
delegate items created by the repeater. a

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,530
repeater

93
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,590
basically repeats data. we tell it three,

94
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,630
it's going to repeat numbers from zero

95
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,380
to two, and we need to specify how these

96
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,800
pieces of data are going to be displayed

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,170
using the delegate. hope this makes sense.

98
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,570
okay you can also give it a model, and

99
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,790
they give you tons and tons of things

100
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,310
you can look at, if you need to know more

101
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,340
about this repeater component, and if we

102
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,930
click we're going to see whatever

103
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,360
component would click that. let's run

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,480
again,

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,550
you click on that April, you see April. you

106
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,280
click on September, you see September. ok

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,350
this is all for this lecture. the next

108
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,820
one we're going to see how you can

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,150
dynamically add and remove data in your

110
00:05:20,150 --> 00:00:00,000
models. I'll see you there.
