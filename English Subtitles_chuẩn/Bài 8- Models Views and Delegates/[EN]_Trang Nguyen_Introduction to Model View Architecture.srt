1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
in this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,680
Model View architecture and QT quick the

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,859
model 2 architecture abbreviated MVC is

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,960
a design pattern that allows you to

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,410
separate the way data is stored and the

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,350
way data is displayed to the user. there

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,570
are three components the model which

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,660
stores your data that you which displays

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,390
your data, and the controller which maybe

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,519
is the exchange of data between the

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,820
model and the view. now tooth doesn't

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,990
implement the model view controller

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,899
pattern completely, it takes the

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,600
controller and strips it down to a

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,450
delegate and the delegate does part of

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,790
the job that a full-blown controller

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,820
would do. in qml specifically, the

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,340
delegate defines how each row in the

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,649
ListView is going to look. you have to

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,969
keep in mind that you have three

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,640
components in QT quick: the model the

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,219
view and the delegate. now that we have

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,320
an idea about the models you delegate

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,230
architecture in QT quick, what components

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,989
are available to us in Qt Quick so

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,110
that we can use them in qml. for

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,540
the view you have list view, grid view

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,460
and if you are the components that we're

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,750
not going to talk about in this chapter.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,659
for the model there is a list model an

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,299
XML list model, we are going to look at

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,520
all these models, and the delegate is

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,100
really a chunk of qml code that

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,350
controls the look of each row in your

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,189
list view, as we going to see. okay and

36
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,200
one thing you need to understand is that

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,689
the data that goes in your model can

38
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,000
really come from anywhere. it can come

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,729
from the database the internet. it can

40
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,520
come from a file that you are storing on

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,220
your drive. it can come from static data

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,070
that you type in your QML code, and a

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,670
model gives you a common interface that

44
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,340
you can use to abstract the real source

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
of data away, so that it can be used by

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,799
many components. for example you can take

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,829
one list model and feed it to a list

48
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,200
view and the grid view, and there is a

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,990
common interface to pass the data back

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,639
and forth between these two components,

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,949
and you don't need to worry about the

52
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,380
detail

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,230
how the data is really stored. this is

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,720
the benefit of having the way you store

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,320
data abstracted away in a model like

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,740
list model and XML list model. okay now

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,600
we want to focus on list model a little

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,090
bit. the way you use the list model in

59
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,430
your qml code, you really give it a list

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,380
of elements that you are going to

61
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,720
display. you can put in these elements

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,240
statically when you define a list model,

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,460
and this is how it looks in code, you

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,650
have a list model component, and inside

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,110
you have a bunch of list elements that

66
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,470
contain attribute and value pieces of

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,150
data.we're going to look at this in a

68
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,910
moment. okay you can put static list

69
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,100
elements in your list model. that's one

70
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,380
way to put in the data, but you can also

71
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,170
use any of these methods that are

72
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,110
available to you to manipulate your

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,200
model at runtime. you can append data,

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
you can clear data, you can get an

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,820
element you can insert, move, remove, and

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,010
you can use all these functions, we are

77
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,630
going to have a chance to use some of

78
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,020
these in one of the upcoming lectures.

79
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,700
there are also two properties that are

80
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,950
available to you: count gives you the

81
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,980
number of elements in your model, and

82
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,020
dynamic roles is a property that allows

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,130
you to modify the nature of your model

84
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,040
at runtime. if you look at this append

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,620
method, it takes a parameter of j/s

86
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,440
object dictionary .I want to focus on

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,720
this a little bit. if you are familiar

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,330
with JS, you're going to recognize what

89
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,190
we have here. this is a just an object,

90
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,560
and this is how you pass data in your

91
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,900
model dynamically, you pass something

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,450
like this. we just looked at an example

93
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,640
of how you can build your list model, and

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,950
you see that it takes country and

95
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,980
capital here. if we were to put in a

96
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,740
piece of data like this dynamically, we

97
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,140
would pass in adjust an object that is

98
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,959
structured like this. okay when you pass

99
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,150
a list element dynamically, you pass it

100
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,670
as a JSobject, this is what we mean

101
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,850
here. in QML terminology these

102
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,478
attributes are called roles, okay so we

103
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,029
have two roles in our list model, here we

104
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,950
have a country role and we have

105
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,560
capital role, and we give values to these

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,260
roles. these roles can be named to be

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,330
anything really, but you need to remember

108
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,730
the name you gave them here, because

109
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,340
you're going to use them to refer to

110
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,500
this piece of data in your delegates

111
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,570
that we're about to see. we just looked

112
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,630
at one type of models that we have want

113
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,180
to look at XML list model. this is a

114
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,610
model that allows you to wrap around an

115
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,970
XML file that is either local or coming

116
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,420
from the internet, and it allows you to

117
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,520
automatically read the data from the XML

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,220
file, and fit it to your list view, or

119
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,350
other views that you might have in you

120
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,080
QML file. the source property allows you

121
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,720
to specify where the XML file is going

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,910
to come from, and you have a set of

123
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,980
queries that allow you to fetch the data

124
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,400
in your XML file. and you can use XPath,

125
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,010
this is a technology that allows you to

126
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,310
parse an XML file and take the data that

127
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,770
you want from that file. we're going to

128
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,320
see how this works. I take away from here

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
is that this model wraps around an XML

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,280
file and allows you to extract data from

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
there automatically, and fit that your

132
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,250
list view or grid view if you happen to

133
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,920
need that. and the last piece of the

134
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,480
puzzle that we're going to look at is

135
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,880
the ListView, which is going to tie all

136
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,650
the things we've talked about together.

137
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,530
the ListView has a model property which

138
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,690
lends to the model that you want to show

139
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,150
in the ListView, you have a delegate that

140
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,760
controls how each role in the ListView is

141
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,340
going to look, and we have highlight

142
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,770
header and footer that allows you to

143
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,870
decorate your ListView to make it look

144
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,300
better, and right here we have an example

145
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,340
for this view. this is how you define it,

146
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,960
and we're going to look at this in

147
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
detail in a few upcoming lectures. ok

148
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,640
this should be all to spice up your

149
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,430
appetite to work with models and views

150
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,920
in QT quick. in the next lecture we're

151
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,660
going to start looking at list view and

152
00:06:22,660 --> 00:00:00,000
list model in detail, I'll see you then
