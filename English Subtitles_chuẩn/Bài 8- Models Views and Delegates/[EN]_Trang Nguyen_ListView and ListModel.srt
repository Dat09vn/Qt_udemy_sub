1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
in this lecture we're going to see how

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,170
you work with list view and list model

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,930
intuitive quick list view is going to

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,050
display our data list model is going to

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,809
control how we store our data. we're

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,790
going to go to QT creator and start

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,340
working with us, here we are in QT

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,960
creator we're going to create our

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,680
project.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,439
it's a QT quick application as usual.

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,289
we're going to call it list view list

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,359
model demo. choose our QT version, choose

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,320
our kit, and finish. we're going to change

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,390
the title here to say a ListView, we want

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,969
to start by putting a ListView component

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:53,969
inside. we're going to give it an ID. it's

17
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,350
going to "fill the parent" and we need to

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,180
specify a model property, and the

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,420
delegate property for it. we're not going

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,909
to specify that right now, what we want

21
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,830
to do is come to the documentation, and

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,530
look at this. "ListView" in here. at this

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,869
place data from models created from

24
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,110
Wilton qml types like list model and XML

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,030
list model. we are going to look at XML

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,700
list model later, now we want to focus on

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,150
this model. a ListView has a model which

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,820
defines the data to be displayed, and the

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,860
delegate which defines how the data

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,740
should be displayed. items in a list you

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,640
are laid out horizontally or vertically.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,860
list views are inherently Flickable

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,110
because ListView inherits flickable, so

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,000
you don't need to wrap your elements in

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,950
a flickable component to be able to

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,229
scroll through more content. a flickable

37
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,290
about is Boston by default. okay now that

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,570
you have a better idea on the ListView,

39
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,090
how do we specify the model or the

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,479
delegate. let's start by the model. we are

41
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,320
going to use the list model component.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,850
want to give it an ID of model ID and

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,810
model ID, and we want to specify it here

44
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,030
so that we get rid of this error here. I

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,250
don't really like this, so a model ID

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,930
let's comment this delegate first, so

47
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,330
that we get rid of these errors. okay we

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,640
have our list model here. we need a way

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,380
to put in the data that should be

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,160
displayed by the ListView, and for that

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,650
to use a list element. let's look at that

52
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,550
in the documentation. "list element". let's

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,580
look at "more" list elements are defined

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,180
inside list model and represent items in

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,220
the list that will be displayed using

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,000
list view or repeater, you put in the

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,980
data like this, you wrap your data in

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,790
list element. what I am going to do is

59
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,000
come back to the code here, and put in a

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,280
bunch of list elements that I had

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
prepared. to save you some typing, but it

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,019
really is easy you have a list element

63
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,810
component, and you specify your

64
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,180
attributes and the values for your

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,519
attributes. in QML these are

66
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,700
called roles but you can call it

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,769
whatever you want. the important thing is

68
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,290
that you know how to use it. so we have

69
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,570
our model and it has a list of items

70
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,970
that should be displayed by the view

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,220
that we're going to attach to this model,

72
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,630
and the model has two data sets, one is

73
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,550
for the country that you specify like

74
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,489
this, and the other is the capital of the

75
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,470
country that you specify like this.

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,140
notice that your attributes here can

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,690
really be anything, a specified country

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,910
and capital here because that's what I

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,970
want to work with in this lecture, but as

80
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,500
you see in the lecture here, you can

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,540
really put in anything, they have name

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,000
and Coast depending on what you are

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,590
designing for. you're going to have

84
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,110
different things defined in here. okay

85
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,480
now we have our list model and you might

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,250
not believe it but this is all you need

87
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,350
to have a model that you can display in

88
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,540
a view. the next thing we want to define

89
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,290
is the delegate. how do you define this.

90
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,450
We go to the bottom of the

91
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:28,140
model, and say "component". so far we have

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,500
used components as external qml files,

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,020
but you can also define an inline

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,660
component like this, okay it is the same

95
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,330
thing. we want to give it an ID, it's

96
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,750
going to be delegateID, inside we want

97
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,240
to put the rectangle component. let's

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,330
give it an ID as well, rectangleID, we

99
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,420
give it a width that is equal to the

100
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:06,320
parent width, give it a height of 50, and

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,890
we give it a color of beige, we want the

102
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,310
border color of yellowgreen and the

103
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,290
radius of 10, on this rectangle here, so

104
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,150
we have the rectangle we want a way to

105
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,060
display some text inside, so we want to

106
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,560
put in a text component. give it an idea

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,800
of textID. we want it centered in the

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,280
parent, and we want it to have a pointsize

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,610
of 20 let's try this. okay now we

110
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,560
are going to see something important.

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,500
from the component here, that is our

112
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,380
delegate, by the way we can come back to

113
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,990
the top here and specify our delegate,

114
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,930
because we have it now. so we can say

115
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,280
"delegateID", when you try the model and

116
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,290
the delegate and if you like this in the

117
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,140
list view, something important happens.

118
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,780
you can access data in the model

119
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,170
directly without doing anything else, so

120
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,390
for example, what we can do we can access

121
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,000
the country and the capital attributes

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,310
from the current element that we are

123
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,940
displaying in the delegateID. so what I

124
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,730
want to do now I want to say "text" it is

125
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,960
going to be "country".

126
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:38,190
"+" let's put a column in the middle

127
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,200
and say "capital". notice that these are

128
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,660
the attributes in the model that we are

129
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,850
accessing. okay we didn't need to do

130
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,920
anything else, we are able to do this

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,320
because these things are tied together

132
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,960
in the ListView like this. right now we

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,210
can run the application and see what it

134
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,080
looks like. let's run it. okay.

135
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,470
you see that we have a list of elements

136
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,560
and we have countries and capitals, I

137
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
want to shrink the height of this then,

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,870
and you see that we aren't able to

139
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,260
scroll to see the data. okay so if you

140
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,960
have more data than can be displayed in

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,170
the available window, you can scroll to

142
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,320
see things. this is the effect of the

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,380
bolt inflickable component that is in the

144
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,990
ListView, and this is really how you work

145
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,900
with a ListView and a list model. you

146
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,140
define your ListView like this, and you

147
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,380
give it some positioning as you would do

148
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,600
for any component, in this case we wanted

149
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,150
to fill the parent, and you give it a

150
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,000
model by specifying the ID of the model.

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,210
our model is nothing special, it's a

152
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,760
bunch of list elements wrapped in a list

153
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,190
model component, and our delegate is a

154
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,980
custom component like this, and inside we

155
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,370
have a rectangle that contains a text

156
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,700
element. that is going to contain the

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,200
attributes of the list element in our

158
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,080
case. another thing you can do is make

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,590
the list element inside the ListView

160
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,870
clickable. the way you do that you can

161
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,230
put a mouse area in the delegate, so

162
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,430
let's say "Mousearea", we want it to fill

163
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,770
the parent, and the parent is going to be

164
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,340
this delegate rectangle here, so we're

165
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,630
going to say "onClicked"

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,540
"console.log("clicked on:")", we want to say the

167
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,100
"capital", remember that we are still in

168
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,290
the delegate so we can access distance

169
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,500
without a problem. put in a column, and

170
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,600
say "country"

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,770
let's run. we have our things here, and if I

172
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,350
click on Rwanda, here you see that I

173
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,290
clicked on Kigali Rwanda, let's click on

174
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,830
Paris Paris, France

175
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,350
Uganda Kampala Uganda, and ladies and

176
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,600
gentlemen this is how you work with the

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,090
list view and the list model. the list

178
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,580
view controls how you display your data,

179
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,100
and the list model controls how your

180
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,910
data is saved. and the delegate controls

181
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,970
how each data item is displayed in the

182
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,850
view. the delegate is this rectangle here

183
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,760
notice that the decoration that we put

184
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,280
on the delegate is here, this is the font

185
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,820
size that we specified here, this is the

186
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,940
color beige that is the background, this

187
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,420
is the yellow green border color that we

188
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,940
specified here. you can control all these

189
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,460
aspects of how your elements are

190
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,280
displayed in the delegate element that

191
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,490
you tied to your ListView. hope this

192
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,730
makes sense. ok I have used my delegate

193
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,700
as an external component just to show

194
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,860
you that you can do this, but we can also

195
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,260
make this inline and I also want you to

196
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,300
see that. so I am going to copy the

197
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,800
rectangle inside our component here.

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,020
selected copy and I'm going to comment

199
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,400
it challenge, ok so. we don't need it

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,030
anymore

201
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,660
in what we're going to do. and what we

202
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,320
can do is come here, comment this out

203
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,510
because I want you to keep this for

204
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,780
reference. we can say "delegate" and paste

205
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,810
in our rectangle in line like this, and

206
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,840
it's great to work the same. let's run.

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,340
mmm and you see that it is the same

208
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,700
thing, click on India New Delhi ,you see

209
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,070
that things are the same as they were

210
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,520
before, you can specify your delegate or

211
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,580
your model in line like this if you want

212
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,860
to. this is all hard to say in this

213
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,170
lecture. I hope you have a better idea of

214
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,480
how you work with list views and list

215
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,090
models to display your data. in the next

216
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,650
lecture, we're going to see how you work

217
00:11:14,650 --> 00:00:00,000
with direct models.I'll see you there.
