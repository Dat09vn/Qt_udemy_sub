1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
in this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,140
another aspects of decorations in your

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,230
list views, and that is using sections to

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,200
group your data in similar groups. we're

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,240
going to go to QT creator and play

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,089
with it. okay here we are, in Qt Creator.

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,340
we're going to create a new project.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,279
it's a QT quick application, we call it

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,279
DecorationSectionDemo, save it in the

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,699
usual location. choose our Qt version.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,390
choose our kit, and finish. we want to

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,140
change the title here. it is another kind

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,739
of decoration, so we say that here. I

14
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,320
want to have a mListView. it's going to

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,140
be the usual thing really. the idea is

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,430
going to be mListView. it's going to

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:01,710
fill the parent, and we are going to

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,140
specify a delegate which is going to be

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,390
an external component, so we're going to

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,070
say "delegateID" like this. I want to put

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,670
in a model that I have prepared to save

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,180
some typing. it is nothing special.

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,310
it is a ListModel with ListElement.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,400
right now we have roles name and company.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,580
what we want to do is to group these

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,310
people in all this view based on the

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,799
company where they work. so now we have a

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,979
model, let's check the ID mListModel.

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
mListModel. this is okay.

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,619
we want to specify our delegate. again I

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,930
am going to put in our delegate like

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,680
this. Press ctrl A ctrl I to align. it is

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,420
the same thing we've seen before. we have

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,090
an ID inside, it is a rectangle that

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,909
specifies how each element in the list

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,130
view is going to look. so it's a

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,799
rectangle with the background color of

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,790
beige, border color yellow green, it has

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,280
round edges, and inside we have a test

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,829
component that says the names of the

41
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,129
person. ok we don't want to display the

42
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,980
company, we only display

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,800
the name of the person in the delegate

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,530
here, and we have access to this because

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,620
the delegate has access to both the

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,799
model and the view. the data in there and

47
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,890
the functions that are inside. okay now

48
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,069
we have our model, we have our delegate,

49
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,709
and we have our listview, we want to

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,069
know how to group the elements together.

51
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,890
let's go back to the documentation, find

52
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,319
listview. if we look at the list of

53
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,209
properties that we have, we have one

54
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,269
called section. click on that and you're

55
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,980
going to see that this is a grouped

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,160
property. ok this property's determined

57
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,450
the expressions to be evaluated and

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,030
appearance of Deception levels, this is

59
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,220
what you use to group your elements

60
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,010
based on a criteria of the data that is

61
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,310
stored in the model. in this case, we want

62
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,950
to group the people based on the company

63
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,019
where they work at, and the company is

64
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,450
also stored in the model in all 

65
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,260
listmodel here. so we want to put an A

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,569
section here. this is how you work with

67
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,709
it. you can do this separately like they

68
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,349
are doing it here in the examples. if you

69
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,519
scroll down you're going to see an

70
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,130
example of how you work with this. section,

71
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,109
property section, criteria section,

72
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,660
delegate like this, but I want to show

73
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,970
you another syntax, because you need to

74
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,340
see that too. you can specify it like

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,880
this directly, and you can specify the

76
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,280
properties inside like this. the first

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,650
thing we want to specify is the property

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,870
that we are going to group by. ok we want

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,480
to specify it in here, in quotes, it is

80
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,359
company in the model, criteria is going

81
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,389
to be usage and full strength.

82
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,579
if we go back in the documentation,

83
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,840
you're going to see that the criteria

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,329
holds the criteria for forming each

85
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,329
section based on section property. you

86
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,339
can make it a full string, which is

87
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,409
going to show the entire thing. this is

88
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,380
the default or you can group by first

89
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,540
character, so if you had something

90
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,280
like an address book, it's going to group

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,670
people by ABC and things like that. but

92
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,560
we are going to use full string in

93
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,200
this example here. so we specify full

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,510
string, so we are going to specify a

95
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,700
delegate. this is going to be the

96
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,600
delegate for the section headers. we want

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,660
to put in a rectangle like this, because

98
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,430
I don't really want to type this again,

99
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm going to put in this rectangle

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,620
ctrl A ctrl I, and I'm going to

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,400
try and explain it, so the rectangle is

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,600
what we have in here. we have an ID for

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,340
this rectangle. we have a width and a

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,790
height, a color, a border, radius. this is

105
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,520
nothing new to you. right now inside we

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,610
have a text component. it has an ID. the

107
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,390
text is going to be the section header.

108
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,490
this property holds what you are

109
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,610
grouping by. in this case we are grouping

110
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,380
people by company, so we're going to see

111
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,650
a section for a company of Google. we are

112
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,110
going to see a section for a company of

113
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,330
10 cent, Apple, Baidu and things like that.

114
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,150
this is the data that you have in this

115
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,760
section property is art your section

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,630
here. ok we Center that and specify a

117
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,390
point size for the font. we also want to

118
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,210
make this clickable, and we display the

119
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,190
section here. by now we have our

120
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,740
components in place, and the meat of this

121
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,130
lecture is really this section, you see

122
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,160
here. we are trying to group the data in

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,800
our model based on company. the company

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,910
is the role that we have in our model, we

125
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,550
want to group by company. we are going to

126
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,840
show the criteria for group end in full

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,580
string, so we are going to show the

128
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,620
full names of the companies that we are

129
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,130
grouping by, and the way the section

130
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,980
header is going to look is specified in

131
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,960
this delegate component here. it's going

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
to be a rectangle, inside we're going to

133
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,860
have a text element, and the text

134
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,110
is going to be displayed is the section

135
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,600
header, and it's going to be the same

136
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,900
thing as the name of the company we are

137
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,210
grouping by. I hope this makes sense, and

138
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,070
if it's not clear,

139
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,260
maybe it's going to be more clear if we

140
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,340
run the application. so we run it. mm-hmm

141
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,700
you see that our people are grouped by

142
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,180
the companies they work at. if we look in

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,720
our model, you see that Seth Morris works

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,060
at Google. jack may works at Apple. Mary

145
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,120
beige works at 10cent. and you see what

146
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,640
data in here. so sometimes you need this,

147
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,400
when you do, this will come in handy.

148
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,470
but one thing you need to know is that

149
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,520
for your data to be displayed correctly,

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,950
you need to have your elements stored

151
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,910
contiuously. what do I mean? let's take

152
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,990
Seth Morris here, copy the element and

153
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,580
put it at the end of the list in the

154
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,690
model. let's run again. mm-hmm you see

155
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,240
that we have Google and we have Miriam,

156
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,210
but if we go to the bottom. you see that

157
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,180
we have another Google header, and we have

158
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,000
Seth Morris inside. and this is really

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,030
how the sectioning works. if you don't

160
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,660
have your elements continuously, you are

161
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,240
going to have the header on every piece

162
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
of element that comes after the other

163
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,460
element. in this case Google is coming

164
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,770
back after Baidu, and the ListView is

165
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,530
going to let you know that Seth Morris

166
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,380
works at Google by putting a header like

167
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,780
this. I hope this makes sense. if you want

168
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,990
to have only one header for each company,

169
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,850
you're going to have to store your

170
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,300
elements continuously in the model. and

171
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,170
put it back like it was before. let's put

172
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,450
this first again, run our application, and

173
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,000
this is what we had before. one thing you

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,130
need to know is that the look of the

175
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,830
section header is controlled by the

176
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,849
delegate property in your section. what

177
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,900
we have here is rectangle. this is all

178
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,700
had to say in this lecture. I hope you

179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,650
know how you can group your elements in

180
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,960
