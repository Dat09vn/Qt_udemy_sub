1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,829
in this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,049
how you can add some decorations to your

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,069
ListView.

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,930
specifically we're going to look at how

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,849
you can work with headers footers and

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,670
highlights. let's go to QT create or and

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,580
do a demo about that. here we are in QT

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,870
creator we're going to start a new

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,939
project. it's a Qt quick 2 application.

10
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,170
we call it HeaderFooterHighlightDemo,

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,769
choose our Qt version, choose our kit

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,460
and finish. we want to change this title

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,960
here, and we want to go to the last

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,690
example, and copy the code we had in

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,149
there, because that's going to be our

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,879
start. so we're going to copy everything

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,600
in the window like this, bring it over in

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,610
our new piece of code here.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,840
let's close this, we don't need it

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,539
anymore.

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,180
if you go to the documentation for list

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,120
view, you're going to see that we have a

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,610
few properties that we haven't seen

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,689
before. we have a property called footer

25
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,200
here, we have a header, and we have

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,740
another called highlight. the footer

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,780
holds the component to use as a footer,

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,759
you can specify a footer for your

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,430
ListView. the header is the same, you can

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,610
specify a header for your list view, and

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,880
highlight displays how the data changes

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,150
when you select the current item. it is a

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,369
visual representation that you see in

34
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,500
the listview when you select something.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,350
we'd like to see how this works. we're

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,840
going to go back to our code here, and

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,439
specify our header component. we're going

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:54,110
to go down the list and, say "component".

39
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,149
it's going to be our header, so we're

40
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,850
going to say "headerID" for the ID, and

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,259
inside we want to put a rectangle

42
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,320
component. it really is the same thing we

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,110
did when we defined our delegate. we're

44
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,989
going to specify how our header is going

45
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,450
to look, and the data that is going to be

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,390
inside.

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,209
let's give it an ID. it's going to have

48
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,610
a width which is going to be the same as

49
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,050
for the parent. it's going to have the

50
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,410
height, we want this to be 50 in height.

51
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,570
we want him to have a color of yellow

52
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,390
green, and we want to specify a border.

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,300
our border is going to look like this.

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,700
it's going to have this color, and it's

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,670
going to be 2 in width inside, we want to

56
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,370
have a text component as usual. it's

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,140
going to be centered, the text is going

58
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,330
to say "months", and it's going to have a

59
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,590
point size of 20. let's do 20. so we can

60
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,540
go back to our list view here and

61
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,180
specify the header. so we're going to say

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,510
"header" and say "headerID". this is really

63
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,940
all we need. let's run the application,

64
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,910
and see what we have.

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,950
hmm we have a good header on top here.

66
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,590
and this is how you control how the

67
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,959
header of the ListView looks, if you

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,090
happen to need this. we can do the same

69
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,920
thing for the footer, but we're going to

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,079
do that in line, so we're going to say

71
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,350
"footer" and specify a rectangle component

72
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,130
like this. we want it to have the same

73
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,400
width as the parent, a height of 15 just

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,220
like the header, and the color is going

75
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,700
to be dodgerblue, if we run, we're going to

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,890
have a footer at the bottom of the list

77
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,010
view. and you can put in a piece of

78
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,410
content if you want really. you can put

79
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,690
in whatever you want. now we want to

80
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,480
highlight every element as you select it.

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,700
you see that if we click we see November

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,850
for example, but it would be better if we

83
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,450
had a visual representation of what is

84
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,340
the current element. that's what

85
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,890
highlights are for. so we can come back

86
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,220
to

87
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,830
listview and specify a highlight, so

88
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,770
we're going to say "highlight", it's going

89
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,830
to be a rectangle, the same thing really.

90
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,480
it's going to have the same width as the

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,330
parent, the color is going to be blue, and

92
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,280
it's going to have round edges, so we

93
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,040
want to specify a radius, let's put in 14,

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,640
and let's give it a border color of

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,960
yellow green. right now we need to set

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,660
the correct item to the list view when

97
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,120
we click on an item, and we do that in

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,160
the delegate if you remember, we click on

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,470
an item and we show what we click on

100
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,250
here, so what we can do is let's look

101
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,580
again at the ID of the ListView. we can

102
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,410
say in here "mListView", "currentIndex"

103
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,980
equals index, and this index property is

104
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,040
coming from the model, when it feeds us

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,770
the data to show in that particular

106
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,800
delegate text item. hope this makes sense.

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,050
when it gives us the data to show from

108
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,850
the model for example, when we grab the

109
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,130
model data here, we also receive a bunch

110
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,260
of other properties that we can use, and

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,140
one of them is the index that specifies

112
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,140
the index of the element that we

113
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,860
received in the model. okay so the index

114
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,200
is going to start from 0 in the model, so

115
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,490
January is 0, February is 1, and as you go

116
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,800
up, you increase until you get to

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,380
December which is index 11. I hope this

118
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,660
makes sense. ok we are setting the

119
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,950
current index when we click on the item.

120
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,930
let's run the application and see that

121
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:24,160
we are having this highlight work. our

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,770
app is here, but you see we have a

123
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,950
problem, where is it?

124
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,020
uh-huh we forgot to say width here. I

125
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,530
make this mistake a lot, so don't be like

126
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,760
me. let's run again. ok you see 

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,780
it's clicked,

128
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,230
but you see that our rectangle is not

129
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,960
visible, and if you watch, you see that we

130
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
are seeing the highlight rectangle move

131
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,810
in the background, and this says that the

132
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,560
data is laid on top of that rectangle, so

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
what we can do, we can bring it up by

134
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
increasing its Z index, so we're going to

135
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,800
come back to the highlight, and specify a

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,940
Z of three, the Z property of your

137
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,090
element specifies how high it is if you

138
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,580
have two items stacked on top of each

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,780
other. let's run again. uh-huh

140
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,570
you see that our how light is on top now,

141
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,669
but it is covering the data so we're not

142
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,850
seeing anything. a hack that I have done

143
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,100
to make this work is set the opacity of

144
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,979
this thing to be a little bit low. so we

145
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,169
can come back to the highlight here, and

146
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:42,570
set opacity of 0.1. let's run again.

147
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,490
mm-hmm and you see that we have a visual

148
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,880
confirmation of whatever element that we

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,940
choose. this is good. isn't it. and I hope

150
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,280
this really gives you an introduction of

151
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,710
how you can work with header, footer and

152
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,190
highlight in your list views to make the

153
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,590
data more presentable. in the next

154
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,090
lecture, we see how you can

155
00:08:04,090 --> 00:00:00,000
work with sections. I'll see you there.
