1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
In this lecture, we're going to see how we

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,310
can work with custom settings in qml. We

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,440
have looked at the documentation for

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,860
settings, and we just saw a way to let

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,019
the system save everything for you

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,920
without you doing much more, but when you

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
do things this way you pay a performance

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
cost of saving the data whenever any of

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
this property changes, and sometimes you

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,300
don't want this. A solution for that is

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,609
to save the data yourself, and they give

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,130
an example of how you can do that. You

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,320
basically have a settings component, it

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,809
has an ID and it has a set of properties

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,550
that you want to save. In this case we

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,010
want to save this state. And you see that

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,500
this item here is reading state

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
information from our Settings component

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,350
here. This is one thing you need to do,

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,270
you need to read whatever property you

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,890
want to save from these Settings

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,920
component, and you have to choose a time

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,440
when you want to save your data. In this

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,629
case, we are saving the data when this

25
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,480
component is destroyed. We are saying 

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,170
settings.state = page.state. We are taking

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,880
this state from this component and

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,210
saving it in the Settings component here

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,659
when this component dies. And notice that

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,090
as you use your application, you may get

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,810
a chance to change the states, and this

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,700
changes are going to be saved in here.

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,820
Notice that you pass the default value

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,970
here, so if you don't have the state set,

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,630
it is going to be "active" by default. To

36
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,939
play with this, we are going to go to 

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,880
Qt creator, find a project we have done

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,009
before, so I'm going to go into recent

39
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,259
projects, and I'm going to find the

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,890
project we did, that project is 

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,189
StatesWithGradiant. I want you to go and find

42
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,140
it, and open it in Qt creator like

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,630
this. If we run it, you see that it had a

44
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,210
scene like this, and we were able to

45
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,110
change between summer and spring, okay, by

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,628
changing states like this. So what we

47
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,730
want is to save the state

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,489
that we are in, and when we close the

49
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,580
application, we want to save the state,

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,190
and when we run it, we want to pick up

51
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,819
the state we saved last time. To be able

52
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,349
to play with this, we're going to create a

53
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,080
new project and copy over all the files

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,660
so that things are nice and clean, I

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,060
don't like to do things over other

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,599
projects, because it confuses students. So

57
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,099
what we're going to do is create a new

58
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,709
project. I want to do all this live so

59
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,370
that you see everything. Qt Quick application.

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,950
We're going to call it SettingsDemo2

61
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,650
because this is the second one. Save it

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,590
in the usual location, hit next, choose

63
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,319
your QT version, choose your kit, and

64
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,500
finish. We want to change this to "Custom

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,530
settings", because you are saving things

66
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,010
yourself. We want to go to the states

67
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,690
with gradient demo project, go in 

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,220
QML, and find our QML file. We don't have

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,980
any special import, but we want to copy

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,290
everything in here. So we're going to

71
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,959
grab everything in the window here, as

72
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,160
you see, except for the properties of the

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,049
window, because we have our own

74
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,049
properties in this new project of ours

75
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,480
here. We're going to paste the data in

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,639
here, and if you look, you see that we

77
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,519
have images in here, so we need to also

78
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,579
import those images. What I want to do, I

79
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,919
want to go where this project is saved,

80
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,160
and go Show in Explorer... I have a folder

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,169
of images here, I want to copy it, go

82
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,230
where my project is saved here, right

83
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,690
click, Show in Explorer, and I am going to

84
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,480
paste in this folder of images. Now I

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,329
have it in SettingsDemo2. I can

86
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,728
close this, add a new resource file, add a

87
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:25,320
new, choose Qt, resource file,

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,030
it's going to be resources, next, next,

89
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,520
until the finish, add the prefix, take

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,400
this out, hit enter, because we don't want

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,240
to have a prefix, add files, images, and

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,110
we put in our spring and summer images.

93
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,190
We save this. And if we run this project

94
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,340
of ours, SettingsDemo2, we should

95
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,640
have everything we had in this 

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,900
StatesWithGradientsDemo project. Let's wait

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,650
and see, and we can change between states.

98
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,380
We can close this application and close

99
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,960
these StatesWithGradientsDemo project

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,200
because we don't need it anymore,

101
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,670
close everything in here because we

102
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,470
don't want things confusing us, and open

103
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,720
our QML file because this is where we

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,090
want to work. First thing we want to do

105
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,880
is to import the settings, because that's

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,030
what we are going to be using in this

107
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,140
lecture, and we want to go back to the

108
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,840
documentation and adapt this example to

109
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,630
save our state. Notice that they have a

110
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,850
settings block here, we can copy it,

111
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,830
come back to our project, we want to go

112
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,170
at the end of the rectangle component,

113
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,960
this rectangle here, and it is ending

114
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,390
here, and we want to put in the settings

115
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,520
that we copied from the documentation.

116
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,400
The id is settings... we can keep that,

117
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,890
there's no problem... Ctrl+A Ctrl+I to align...

118
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,000
Down here you see that we are saving the property

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,080
of State. We want to make this state

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,440
spring by default, and we want to make

121
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,190
the application read the state data from

122
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,830
our settings component, so we should take

123
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:29,120
this out, and say state : settings.state.

124
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,420
This is the second thing you have

125
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,850
to do. The first one is put in your

126
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,890
settings component like this, give it an

127
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,840
ID, make your application read whatever

128
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,090
that are you saved from the settings. And

129
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,100
the last thing you need to do to make

130
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
this work is to provide a component 

131
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:56,270
on destroyed.. onDestruction, that's what

132
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,010
we want, okay. We choose to do it here, but

133
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,660
you can really save it whenever you want.

134
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,610
You can even do this when a user presses

135
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,580
some button or whatever. We are doing it

136
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,240
right now

137
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
when this rectangle is destroyed. And in

138
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,950
here we should say settings.state

139
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,790
equals whatever state is saved in the

140
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,560
rectangle here. And notice that this

141
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,070
state is part of the rectangle component

142
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,750
that contains everything, okay. This is

143
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,180
where this state is defined, so we should

144
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,930
save it by saying RectId, I think

145
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,670
that's our ID here for this rectangle...

146
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,850
containerRectId... that's what we have, so

147
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,850
we should say containerRectId.state

148
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,880
like this. And before we run the

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,100
application, we need to remember to go

150
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,550
back to the main cpp file, and put in our

151
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,730
application information ctrl A ctrl I to

152
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,210
align, and I want to change this because

153
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,640
it might conflict with the settings we

154
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,100
did in the last lecture. You don't want

155
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,890
to have two applications with the same

156
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,780
set of information, you're just going to

157
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
mess up things.

158
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,840
Let's run. If everything works, we should

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,610
be able to save our state, whether spring

160
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,850
or summer. So we are in spring right now.

161
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,690
We can change to be in summer, close the

162
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,880
application, run it, we start in summer, we

163
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,419
change to spring, close the application,

164
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,629
run it,

165
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,760
you see that we are in spring. Let's

166
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,790
change to summer again we should see

167
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,540
summer when we run, ok, summer. Let's

168
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,770
change to spring,

169
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,290
close the application, we should see

170
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,740
spring when we run, and it is spring here.

171
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,340
Now you know how to save your data

172
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,350
customally when you close the application,

173
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,440
or whenever you want to save the data. We

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,480
are saving when the rectangle component

175
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,700
is destroyed, but you can really save it

176
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,940
anywhere. The bulk of this is defining

177
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,640
the settings component, make your

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,740
application read its properties from the

179
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,350
Settings component, and choose a time

180
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,540
when you want to save the data, in this

181
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,090
case we saved the data when the

182
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,340
rectangle component is destroyed. And

183
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,590
ladies and gentlemen, this is how you

184
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,750
work with settings to save your data, you

185
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,820
can completely let the settings

186
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,130
component handle the data for you, pay

187
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,380
the price in performance of saving the

188
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,990
data whenever a property changes, or you

189
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,880
can choose when you want to save the

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,340
data yourself and do it like we did in

191
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,360
this lecture here.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,160
In the next lecture, we're going to see

193
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,650
how you can save your data using SQLite,

194
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,740
an internal database that is built in

195
00:09:57,740 --> 00:00:00,000
your system. I'll see you in the next lecture.
