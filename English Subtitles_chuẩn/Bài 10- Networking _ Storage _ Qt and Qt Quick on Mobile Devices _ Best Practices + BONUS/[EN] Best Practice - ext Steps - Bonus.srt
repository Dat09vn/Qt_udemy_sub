1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
I'd like to give you a few guidelines

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,930
that are going to help you write qml

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,519
code that is readable. On this

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,130
documentation length you're going to

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,469
find some qml coding conventions and

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,210
they say that they are giving the coding

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,240
conventions they follow in the

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,090
documentation, and they do recommend us

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,660
to follow that. because the code is going

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,210
to be much more readable by others. Okay

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,960
so in your qml file, you're going to

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,960
start by the ID. You learn to follow that

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,440
with the property declarations. And down

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,629
here they have an example, so you see an

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,110
ID. Here we have a qml component. It has

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,940
an ID that is shown here.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,070
You follow that with the properties. If

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,789
you have any properties, you have to put

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,989
them here.

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,610
You follow that will signal declarations.

21
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:56,309
After that you're going to put in your

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,800
JavaScript functions, any JavaScript

23
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,680
function that is embedded in your

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,140
qml file should come here. And then

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,840
you have the properties for the object.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,540
Okay, things like X line width and height

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,420
should come here. If you have a lot of

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,299
JavaScript that you want to assign to a

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,000
property, you should wrap that in a block

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,670
like this, and then after all this, you're

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,430
going to put your child objects. You see

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,850
this rectangle here is a child rectangle

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,250
of the parent rectangle here . Down below

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,680
you put your states. This is basically

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,200
what we did when we looked at states and

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,140
transitions. And you end with the

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,689
transitions that your element might have.

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,659
This is the recommended way: you start

39
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,979
with IDs, property declarations, signal

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,140
declarations, JavaScript functions,

41
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,930
object properties, child objects, states

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,649
and transitions. This is really how your

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,030
qml code should be organized. Down below

44
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,430
to show you how you should use your

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,560
group properties. You really shouldn't do

46
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,360
something like this, anchors left, anchors

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,119
top, anchors bottom and things

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,489
like that. You should group them like

49
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,250
this and say anchors and specify the

50
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,900
properties inside the brackets here. We

51
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,420
looked at this syntax before.

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,390
This is the recommended way to make you

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,120
qml more readable. If a list only

54
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,060
contains one element you can omit this

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,849
square bracket, something like this. Okay.

56
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,120
Instead of doing something like this you

57
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,700
see we have states, we have one state, and

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,560
we put that inside these brackets. You

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,290
can do something like this, and put your

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,440
state inside directly, if it happens to be

61
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,660
only one state. Down here they talk about

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,450
things you should be careful about when

63
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,940
writing some JavaScript in your QML code.

64
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,489
If the script is a single expression

65
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,709
they recommend writing that in line,

66
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,019
something like this. You see here, there

67
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,599
is a binding to the width property of

68
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:01,900
this rectangle here. If the script is a

69
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,329
couple of lines, wrap that in a block. And

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,989
if it is much longer you need to wrap

71
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:10,599
that in a function and call that when

72
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,510
you want to assign something to a QML

73
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,360
property like this. And if javascript is

74
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,819
really too long, you need to put that in

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,250
an external Javascript file and import

76
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,260
that in your QML file and we look at

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,620
this before. Okay these are the

78
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,260
guidelines to help you write Qml code,

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,709
that other people are going to be able

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,349
to read very easily, and that adds value

81
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,630
to the code that you write. If you write

82
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,700
code that only you can read or that

83
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,799
other people really find difficult to

84
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,180
read, it is not a good thing for your

85
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,739
piece of code. Okay so keep this in mind.

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,690
This being the last lecture of the

87
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,940
course, there are two things I would like

88
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,819
to recommend. If you want to push your

89
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,250
QT Quick knowledge further. One is

90
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,310
ready to consult the documentation and

91
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,380
QT itself the documentation includes. It's

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,209
very good and you saw that in the course.

93
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,579
Every time we needed something, we just

94
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,799
looked at the documentation and we had

95
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,260
turned to tons of information just by

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,650
looking at the documentation in QT

97
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,358
create tour or or online. So every time you

98
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,089
need to learn about something, going to

99
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,850
documentation

100
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,220
and see what you can find in there. This

101
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,740
is the documentation for Qt Quick itself.

102
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,300
You see here they talk about some of the

103
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,540
things we even talked about in the

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,419
course, user input, positioning, states, and

105
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,729
transitions, data models, views and data

106
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,500
storage. We have looked at these things,

107
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,300
but if you want to read about the

108
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,270
canvas, you can read about this.

109
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,100
They have particles and graphical effects.

110
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,710
If you want to do some advanced

111
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,790
animations you can look at this. If you

112
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,370
want to extend your qml with C++, these

113
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,490
are good things to look at. One is

114
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,260
QT, the other is the book that we

115
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,840
had a chance to look at in the course.

116
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,479
And this is a very good book and

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,460
knowledge is presented in a very good

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,229
structure. And in fact if you have

119
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,419
finished this course, you really have

120
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,260
good grounds to start looking at some of

121
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,500
these things.

122
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:16,010
This book has one downside is that it

123
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,860
tries and combines C++ and QT quick in

124
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,440
one go. If you don't have a C++

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,440
background, you're not going to find this

126
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,380
very understandable. But if you want to

127
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,570
get started with the C++ side of QT,

128
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,210
happen to have a course on that. So if

129
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,849
you are interested be sure to check it

130
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,460
out. And this is really all I have to

131
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:39,470
offer in terms of tips and tricks on how

132
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,810
to push your knowledge in QT quick

133
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,840
further. Consult the Qt Quick

134
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,300
documentation, look at this book and try

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,000
to look if you can learn something from

136
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,710
this balance. Okay this brings us to the

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,050
end of this course. I'd like to thank you

138
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,360
for enrolling. If you like the course

139
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,150
please consider leaving your honest

140
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,490
review. It helps a lot. And on top of all

141
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm wishing you well on your journey as

142
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,539
the QTquick user interface developer.

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,539
Till next time. Bye
