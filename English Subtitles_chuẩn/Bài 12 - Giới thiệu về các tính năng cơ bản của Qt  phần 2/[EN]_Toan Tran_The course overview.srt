00:08.440 --> 00:14.310
I'm Ben Hoff and welcome to 'Mastering Qt 5 GUI Programming' by Packt publishing.

00:14.310 --> 00:20.160
As a brief introduction to myself, I actually have a lot of experience with Qt, having started programming with both C++ and

00:20.160 --> 00:23.400
Qt, developing realtime graphical simulations.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.820
I also have extensive experience with PyQt, creating Chat GUIs and have had success integrating

00:29.880 --> 00:33.990
OpenCV and Qt to provide facial recognition applications.

00:34.140 --> 00:39.720
If you'd like to start me on the web feel free to visit my blog, YouTube channel or follow me on

00:39.720 --> 00:40.560
Github.

00:40.770 --> 00:45.990
This course will provide you an in-depth view of the Qt framework, covering both the traditional C++

00:45.990 --> 00:52.780
aspects as well as exploring the newer QML options. To provide a little more depth,

00:52.800 --> 00:58.320
we'll look into moving beyond GUI applications which covers both how the make command line programs

00:58.380 --> 01:05.420
as well as exploring and utilizing some of the network capability to create a simple supercomputing framework.

01:05.460 --> 01:10.870
Once you're done with that, we move on to the model view where we'll explore in depth Qt model view

01:10.950 --> 01:15.010
framework and tease out some of its inner workings.

01:15.030 --> 01:21.420
We'll also look into interacting with the web, showing how to embed web pages in our application as well

01:21.420 --> 01:25.120
as reaching out and interacting with JavaScript on the pages.

01:25.290 --> 01:32.310
Once we're done with Web, we'll move onto the world of multimedia covering recording video, audio and

01:32.310 --> 01:34.540
photos in our applications.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.310
Additionally adding in open computer vision and the Qt 3D module, we will then move on to our first

01:41.310 --> 01:49.900
Qt section covering communicating between QML and C++ as well as creating our own modules and types.

01:49.920 --> 01:57.950
Once we're done introducing QML, we will go more in depth coverage charts, animation, particles and 3D in

01:57.960 --> 02:00.000
visual representations.

02:00.180 --> 02:05.640
We'll start to round out the last of that course covering compiling and distributing for both desktop

02:05.700 --> 02:13.470
and mobile. We will cover Windows, Linux and stack distributions on the desktop and cover how to set up and

02:13.470 --> 02:16.860
distribute apps for Google on mobile.

02:17.220 --> 02:23.340
I expect users to have a basic understanding of Qt and C++ but I'm confident that if you're willing to

02:23.340 --> 02:26.830
learn, you can understand all of the material from this course.

02:26.970 --> 02:31.830
By the end of this course you should have an in-depth knowledge and experience to distribute your

02:31.830 --> 02:34.780
applications on any platform.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.860
So let's go ahead and get started.
