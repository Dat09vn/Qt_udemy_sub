00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
This chapter is all about user input. We

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,069
are going to look at the elements that

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,649
allow the user to type in some text like

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,320
TextInput and TextEdit. We are going to

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,599
look more on the MouseArea that we've

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,179
been using and look at some more of its

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,640
signals. We are also going to look at how

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,650
you can know which key on your keyboard

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,260
was clicked. The other thing we'll see is

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,900
how you transfer focus between you or UI

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,300
components using KeyNavigation and how

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,179
you make sure that focus is transferred

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,030
correctly in your custom components. In 

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,130
the next lectures we are going to tackle

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,559
these subjects, starting with TextInput

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,540
in the next one. I'll see you in the

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:00,000
next lecture.
