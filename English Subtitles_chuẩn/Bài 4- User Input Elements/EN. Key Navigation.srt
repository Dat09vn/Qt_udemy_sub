00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,054
In this lecture we are looking at the

2
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:04,530
key navigation attached property. This is

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,493
a property that adds focus navigation

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,973
properties to focusable UI components.

5
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:13,825
Let's go to QT creator and play with it.

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,077
Here we are in QT creator. Let's

7
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:19,501
create a new project. We call it key

8
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,621
navigation demo. Store it in the usual

9
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,777
location. Hit next. Choose the Q... choose

10
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:31,745
the QT version that you have installed.

11
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:34,784
And choose Ok. We want to change the

12
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:38,776
title here to key navigation demo. We are

13
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:42,780
going to add a row component inside. It's

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,585
going to be in the center of the

15
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:48,375
rectangle. So we're going to Center it in

16
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:51,048
the parent. And we are going to put two

17
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:54,875
rectangles inside. There it is. Going to

18
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,439
be firstrectID. The Width is going

19
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,432
to be 200 and the height is going to be

20
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:06,373
equal to the width. We want to have a

21
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:12,573
border color of black. We want the

22
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:17,244
rectangle to have a color of green and

23
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:20,797
we want it to start with the focus set

24
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,805
to true. It's going to start focused it's

25
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,926
going to be able to receive key events,

26
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,434
because we want to know when it has

27
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,014
focus. We are going to add the keys

28
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:35,943
attached property and listen for the key

29
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:39,944
number 5 being pressed. You already know

30
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:42,664
how to do this from the last lecture, and

31
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:45,336
we are going to say console.log I am

32
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:48,885
rect1 to know that it is the first

33
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,874
rectangle here that has focus. We

34
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:57,100
actually want to copy this rectangle and

35
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,666
paste it down here and modify it a

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,205
little bit. We are going to change the ID

37
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:10,597
and it is going to be blue, why not.

38
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,585
It's not going to have the focus by

39
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,667
default because we want the first one to

40
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,219
start with the focus. And when you hold

41
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,302
down the key number five it is going to

42
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:25,537
say I am red 2. Okay now we get to use

43
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:27,306
key navigation. Key navigation is a

44
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:31,239
property that allows you to navigate

45
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,665
through your UI components, when some key

46
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,510
is pressed. Let's go to each

47
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:45,236
documentation. Okay you can see that we

48
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:48,067
can detect when the backtab is collect

49
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:53,098
down, left, right, up and the tab key. So we

50
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,204
want to move the focus to the right for

51
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:00,007
this first rectangle, when you click on

52
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,184
the right button. So we are going to say

53
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:07,468
keys: key navigation, right. And it's going

54
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:11,165
to move to second rect ID. You specify

55
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:16,554
your target element by its ID. We want to

56
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:19,684
do something similar to the second

57
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:22,604
rectangle here. When you click on the

58
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:27,226
Left button, while this rectangle has

59
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:30,438
focus, we are going to transfer focus to

60
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:33,640
the first rectangle, which is identified

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,806
by this ID, first rect ID and we do that

62
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,114
like this. Okay and how do you know which

63
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:43,513
rectangle has focus? We are going to

64
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,694
press on the key number five and it's

65
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:49,005
going to tell us which rectangle has

66
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,577
focus, like we do in the console out here.

67
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:54,917
Let's run the application. Okay we have

68
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:58,476
two rectangles. The rectangles are laid

69
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:03,028
out in a row component and the green

70
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,607
rectangle because it is the first one is

71
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,145
going to be to the left. The blue

72
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,975
rectangle is second in the row component

73
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:13,638
and it's going to be to the right. Okay

74
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:15,826
so what we want to do is to hold down

75
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,976
the

76
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,555
key number five and you see that

77
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,279
rectangle one has focus. I'm going to

78
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,931
touch the right arrow key on my keyboard

79
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,324
and click on number five again. You see

80
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,631
that rect two has focus. Click on the

81
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:34,298
left arrow key. Click on five. You see

82
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:37,407
that rect one has focus. And you can see

83
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,579
that we are successfully transferring

84
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,237
focus from one rectangle to another

85
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,669
using this key navigation attached

86
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:47,347
property. And again it is an attached

87
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,782
property because the rectangle doesn't

88
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:53,133
have these properties by default. We are

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,484
attaching these properties using this

90
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:58,138
key navigation component here. This is

91
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,209
what is meant when somebody says that a

92
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,098
property is an attached property. Another

93
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,148
thing we can do to make these Apple

94
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,405
powers even better is to handle the

95
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:11,237
unfocused changed signa. Okay so if the

96
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,628
focus changes we are going to check and

97
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,678
see if focus equals to true for this

98
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:20,496
component for this rectangle here. If

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,788
it's true we are going to set its color

100
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:29,418
to gray, and if it isn't we are going to

101
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:39,411
turn it back to green. We are going to do

102
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,439
something similar to the second

103
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:48,068
rectangle. But when it is not focused, we

104
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,708
are going to turn the color back to

105
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,878
being blue, because that's what it was.

106
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,639
And we need to surround this with quotes

107
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:01,448
like this. Let's run the application. We

108
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,057
click on the right. You see that the

109
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,241
second rectangle has focused so it turns

110
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,552
gray. If we hold down the key number five,

111
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,882
it's going to tell us the same thing,

112
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,594
that it has focused. We turn it to the

113
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:18,574
left the first rectangle turns gray, but

114
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:20,704
the second rectangle lost focus so it

115
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,785
turns back to blue. Okay this should

116
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,832
give you an introduction on how to work

117
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,544
with key navigation to transfer focus

118
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,344
between you you icon.

119
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:32,864
But if we go back to the documentation

120
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,195
for key navigation and look at the

121
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,265
description you see that they have an

122
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,617
example here that we can try out. Okay so

123
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:42,589
it basically is four rectangles that are

124
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:44,942
wrapped in a grid component, and the grid

125
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:50,689
component is basically laying your

126
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,592
rectangles or whatever is inside into a

127
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:56,071
grid structure. We have the first

128
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:58,411
rectangle, the second rectangle, the third

129
00:06:58,412 --> 00:07:01,000
one and the fourth one. And if you look

130
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,629
at the properties they have the width

131
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,591
and height, they have a color that

132
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:09,061
depends on whether or not the rectangle

133
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:12,121
is focused, and they transfer focus when

134
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,084
you hold down the right key while this

135
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,385
rectangle has focus focus is going to go

136
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:20,113
to the top right and you can see the

137
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:23,182
sentence. Okay so I am going to copy all

138
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:29,542
this code up to here. Comment out what we

139
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,445
have in our application so far so you

140
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:33,972
don't want to delete it. You want to keep

141
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:36,792
it for reference if you need it in the

142
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:41,914
future. But we are going to paste in the

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,272
code from the documentation. Okay so we

144
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:54,076
have our width component here. Let's run

145
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:54,984
the application and see what it looks

146
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:55,234
like. M-hmm what is wrong.

147
00:07:55,245 --> 00:08:10,500
We didn't close the last bracket here so

148
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,149
we should close it.

149
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:20,169
This looks good. And down here you see

150
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:24,300
that it is smashed. Let's run again. You

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,694
see that this thing is showing but it is

152
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,158
really small. Let's click on right

153
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,111
you see that focus goes to the right.

154
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:34,331
Down goes down. Left it goes left. But

155
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,171
this is very small and it is not

156
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:40,080
centered, so we can use our qml powers to

157
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:43,349
turn it into what we want. I am going to

158
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,259
get rid of this width and height, because

159
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,671
I don't need it.

160
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,399
I am going to Center it in the parent,

161
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,691
and its parent is this window here and I

162
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,790
am going to turn its width and height to

163
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:04,560
100 because 50 is too small to see. Let's

164
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,838
do 100. Copy this. Paste it here, Paste it

165
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:15,679
here. We basically paste it everywhere,

166
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:19,960
where we need it. Let's run the

167
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:23,710
application. It should be in the center

168
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:27,701
now and our rectangles should be bigger.

169
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:32,772
Right, bottom, left, top. This is really

170
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,857
good. This is nothing different from what

171
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:38,071
we did before here. But they are using

172
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:41,158
ternary operators here to change the

173
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,862
color of the rectangle based on whether

174
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,407
or not the rectangle has focus. This is

175
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,129
the only different thing really. The

176
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:52,137
other fans are just transferring focus

177
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,418
to the ID of interest. This covers all

178
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,304
we set up to do in this lecture. And the

179
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,680
next one we're going to look at the

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,947
concept called focus school. I'll see you

181
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:01,687
in the next lecture.
