0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.250
In this lecture we want to look at the

0:00:01.979 --> 0:00:07.980
focus scope qml component. This component

0:00:05.250 --> 0:00:11.219
is very helpful when you are using

0:00:07.980 --> 0:00:14.460
external components in your main.qml

0:00:11.219 --> 0:00:16.350
file. Let's go to QT Creator, create a

0:00:14.460 --> 0:00:19.439
new project and show you what I mean.

0:00:16.350 --> 0:00:21.900
Okay so here we are in QT Creator. We

0:00:19.439 --> 0:00:26.420
are going to create a new project. We

0:00:21.900 --> 0:00:30.840
call it focus scope demo. Hit Next.

0:00:26.420 --> 0:00:34.380
Choose your QT version here and your

0:00:30.840 --> 0:00:39.930
desktop kit as usual. Let's change the

0:00:34.380 --> 0:00:43.140
title to say focus. We want to create a

0:00:39.930 --> 0:00:50.129
rectangle component inside. Give it a

0:00:43.140 --> 0:00:55.940
width of 300, a height of 50, a color of

0:00:50.129 --> 0:00:58.559
beige. I love page.And we make it focused.

0:00:55.940 --> 0:01:02.030
Inside we are going to put a text

0:00:58.559 --> 0:01:06.840
component. The text is going to say

0:01:02.030 --> 0:01:11.760
default by default. And it's going to be

0:01:06.840 --> 0:01:14.130
centered in the parent. Its parent

0:01:11.760 --> 0:01:20.520
happens to be this rectangle here. Let's

0:01:14.130 --> 0:01:22.530 
call this container red. Because we want

0:01:20.520 --> 0:01:24.810
this rectangle to tell us when it has

0:01:22.530 --> 0:01:33.450
focus ,we are going to use the keys

0:01:24.810 --> 0:01:35.790
attached property. And we are going to

0:01:33.450 --> 0:01:38.610
check if it is the key number one that is

0:01:35.790 --> 0:01:49.740
correct. So you already know how to do

0:01:38.610 --> 0:01:51.990
this if event key equals Qt key one. Be

0:01:49.740 --> 0:01:57.509
careful on the spelling that you use

0:01:51.990 --> 0:02:01.320
here. Here it is lowercase K. Here it is

0:01:57.509 --> 0:02:04.710
capital K. We are going to set the text

0:02:01.320 --> 0:02:07.409
of this text component to let us know

0:02:04.710 --> 0:02:10.310
that we have pressed on the key one here. So

0:02:07.409 --> 0:02:10.310
let's give it an ID

0:02:10.690 --> 0:02:25.460
and we are going to say text ID text

0:02:18.460 --> 0:02:36.080
equals. We want to test for at least

0:02:25.460 --> 0:02:39.530
another key. If the key is two, we are

0:02:36.080 --> 0:02:43.300
going to say we pressed on key two. Else

0:02:39.530 --> 0:02:47.480
we are going to say pressed on another

0:02:43.300 --> 0:02:52.880
key. And we are going to say whatever key

0:02:47.480 --> 0:02:55.510
it is by adding it's key to this

0:02:52.880 --> 0:03:00.520
string here. So we're going to say event

0:02:55.510 --> 0:03:03.500
key. Let's run the application.

0:03:00.520 --> 0:03:07.940
Okay we have our base rectangle, I click

0:03:03.500 --> 0:03:10.820
on one, press on one. I press

0:03:07.940 --> 0:03:13.700
two. I press some other key and it gives

0:03:10.820 --> 0:03:15.709
me the key that I pressed. This is what

0:03:13.700 --> 0:03:18.110
we want. So let's say we want to

0:03:15.709 --> 0:03:20.540
instantiate our rectangle component

0:03:18.110 --> 0:03:22.220
multiple times. And we don't want to go

0:03:20.540 --> 0:03:25.100
copy paste since we already know how to

0:03:22.220 --> 0:03:26.840
create custom components. We are going to

0:03:25.100 --> 0:03:29.900
create an external component of this

0:03:26.840 --> 0:03:33.050
rectangle and instantiate it whenever we

0:03:29.900 --> 0:03:35.570
need it in the main.qml file. Let's

0:03:33.050 --> 0:03:43.370
create another qml file. So we're going

0:03:35.570 --> 0:03:51.110
to add new  qml file QT quick two - and

0:03:43.370 --> 0:03:54.380
we call it MButton. It is going to be in

0:03:51.110 --> 0:03:59.930
this project. So we go into main.qml file

0:03:54.380 --> 0:04:02.690
and copy our rectangle here. We are going

0:03:59.930 --> 0:04:06.440
to get rid of this and paste it in here

0:04:02.690 --> 0:04:09.200
and change the import here to 2.11,

0:04:06.440 --> 0:04:12.920
because that the version of QT Quick we

0:04:09.200 --> 0:04:15.470
are using. And because we are arguing qml

0:04:12.920 --> 0:04:21.940
citizens, we are going to wrap this into

0:04:15.470 --> 0:04:21.940
an item element. So let's do that

0:04:22.980 --> 0:04:31.600
and expose the width of this thing. So

0:04:28.720 --> 0:04:34.960
that we can put it in positioners like

0:04:31.600 --> 0:04:43.660
row and columns. Its width is going to be

0:04:34.960 --> 0:04:52.210
container rect ID width. And its height

0:04:43.660 --> 0:04:54.370
is going to be container high. And we

0:04:52.210 --> 0:04:56.320
also want to expose this color so that

0:04:54.370 --> 0:05:01.240
we can specify it whenever we

0:04:56.320 --> 0:05:02.920
instantiate it in the main.qml file. So

0:05:01.240 --> 0:05:11.500
we are going to use the property

0:05:02.920 --> 0:05:12.220
alias. And it is going to refer to the

0:05:11.500 --> 0:05:20.290
container

0:05:12.220 --> 0:05:22.570
rect ID color. And an alias is really a

0:05:20.290 --> 0:05:24.760
way to give your properties a nickname.

0:05:22.570 --> 0:05:27.010
So that you can use them under that

0:05:24.760 --> 0:05:30.460
different name. But this time we are

0:05:27.010 --> 0:05:32.800
defining this alias in the root scope of

0:05:30.460 --> 0:05:35.470
this item. So it will be available for

0:05:32.800 --> 0:05:37.960
other components from the main qml file.

0:05:35.470 --> 0:05:39.910
So what we want to do is to instantiate

0:05:37.960 --> 0:05:42.610
our MButton component. We are going to

0:05:39.910 --> 0:05:45.340
say BMutton and you see that it is

0:05:42.610 --> 0:05:47.980
recognized. So this is the first one. And

0:05:45.340 --> 0:05:53.470
we are going to instantiate the second

0:05:47.980 --> 0:05:55.630
one. But for the second one, we want to

0:05:53.470 --> 0:05:59.230
change the color to green so that we can

0:05:55.630 --> 0:06:01.990
differentiate them. Remember that we

0:05:59.230 --> 0:06:05.770
exposed the color property through this

0:06:01.990 --> 0:06:07.840
property alias. Okay to position this

0:06:05.770 --> 0:06:14.020
things nicely, we're going to wrap them

0:06:07.840 --> 0:06:19.690
into a column and component. Copy this

0:06:14.020 --> 0:06:22.600
and paste it it down here. Run the

0:06:19.690 --> 0:06:25.900
application and see what we get. Which

0:06:22.600 --> 0:06:29.200
one has focus. Let's click on one and you

0:06:25.900 --> 0:06:33.510
see that number one has focus. So let's

0:06:29.200 --> 0:06:33.510
give the first button focus.

0:06:35.400 --> 0:06:45.070
Run the application. I click on one, no

0:06:41.830 --> 0:06:47.380
effect. I click on two, no effect. I click

0:06:45.070 --> 0:06:50.490
on other buttons, no effect. You see that

0:06:47.380 --> 0:06:54.190
it seems like neither button has focus.

0:06:50.490 --> 0:07:02.130
Let's comment this out. Give the second

0:06:54.190 --> 0:07:02.130
rectangle focus. Run the application. And

0:07:03.480 --> 0:07:09.760
if we click on one, you see that it looks

0:07:06.160 --> 0:07:13.390
like the first button has focused even

0:07:09.760 --> 0:07:16.090
if we explicitly told the second button

0:07:13.390 --> 0:07:17.830
to have the focus. This is the problem

0:07:16.090 --> 0:07:20.470
that comes with using external

0:07:17.830 --> 0:07:23.020
components in your qml files when

0:07:20.470 --> 0:07:25.450
transferring focus. Research can be

0:07:23.020 --> 0:07:28.150
unpredictable when you set focused your

0:07:25.450 --> 0:07:30.490
components. To solve this problem, you

0:07:28.150 --> 0:07:33.100
just have to wrap your components into a

0:07:30.490 --> 0:07:39.790
focused scope component. So let's do that.

0:07:33.100 --> 0:07:41.920
Just like this. Let's go to the main file

0:07:39.790 --> 0:07:44.260
and change it a little bit. Because

0:07:41.920 --> 0:07:47.530
sometimes when you don't change the main

0:07:44.260 --> 0:07:49.960
qml file, QT Creator doesn't pick the

0:07:47.530 --> 0:07:52.270
changes you made in external components.

0:07:49.960 --> 0:07:58.690
So I'm going to add a space here. Run

0:07:52.270 --> 0:08:01.660
again. Click on one and you see that the

0:07:58.690 --> 0:08:02.470
second button has focus. This is what we

0:08:01.660 --> 0:08:06.450
set here.

0:08:02.470 --> 0:08:06.450
Let's move the focus to the first button

0:08:07.530 --> 0:08:18.820
like this. Run our application. Click on

0:08:16.120 --> 0:08:21.010
one, you see one has focus. And you can

0:08:18.820 --> 0:08:23.800
see that by wrapping your external

0:08:21.010 --> 0:08:26.020
component into a FocusScope, the

0:08:23.800 --> 0:08:28.510
results of setting you focus property on

0:08:26.020 --> 0:08:30.640
your component is much more predictable.

0:08:28.510 --> 0:08:32.860
This is what I wanted you to see in this

0:08:30.640 --> 0:08:34.870
lecture. If you want to learn more about

0:08:32.860 --> 0:08:37.870
the focus scope component, you can select

0:08:34.870 --> 0:08:39.970
it and hit F1. And you're going to have a

0:08:37.870 --> 0:08:42.970
piece of documentation that you can read.

0:08:39.970 --> 0:08:45.580
But it just says that focus scopes assist

0:08:42.970 --> 0:08:46.630
in keyboard focus handling when building

0:08:45.580 --> 0:08:49.200
reusable

0:08:46.630 --> 0:08:51.550
components. And this is what we just did.

0:08:49.200 --> 0:08:53.530
Discoverers always setup during this

0:08:51.550 --> 0:08:55.720
lecture. In the next chapter, we're going

0:08:53.530 --> 0:08:56.950
to start and look at javascript and see

0:08:55.720 --> 0:08:59.770
how you can use it to add some

0:08:56.950 --> 0:09:01.900
interactivity to your qml. And if you

0:08:59.770 --> 0:09:04.150
noticed, we have been using JavaScript

0:09:01.900 --> 0:09:06.520
all along. But we are going to explain

0:09:04.150 --> 0:09:10.110
these things and shed some light on them.

0:09:06.520 --> 0:09:10.110
I see you in the next lecture.
