1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
In this lecture we are going to look at

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,370
the text input element of QT quick. To

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,290
show of its powers, we are going to build

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,750
the contact panel like this, where the

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,730
user is going to be allowed to type in

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,460
the first name and last name. Let's go to

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,730
QT creator and do this. Here we are in QT

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,680
creator. We are going to create our

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,699
project. It is a "QT Quick Application". We

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,859
are going to name it "TextInputDemo",

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,609
save it in the usual location. We want to

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,740
use this as the default location because

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,920
this is a new chapter. Let's choose our

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,550
Kit, choose "Desktop". And we have our

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,550
project here. The title is going to say

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,960
"TextInput...". We are going to specify our

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,879
Row. Give it the next Y location, specify

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,260
the spacing of 10.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,989
You probably remember the "Row" component

20
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,480
from previous lectures. It is used to

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,780
layout things from left to right. Inside

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,570
we are going to put a Rectangle. This is

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,350
for the first name. Inside we are going

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,990
to put in a Text element for the text.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:34,220
This is going to work like a label. And

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,070
it should be centered in the parent.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,930
Now we want to specify the width and

28
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,180
height of this rectangle in relation to

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,750
the size of the text. That is in here. The

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,000
way we do that you probably know all

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,030
this from the previous lectures. The width

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,130
equals firstNameLabelId.implicitWidth.

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,270
We add a margin of 20. Let's type

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,950
width well. Height is going to be the same.

35
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's run this to see what it looks like.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
Mm-hmm we have a label saying FirstName.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,340
This looks good.

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,070
We want to add a TextInput element

39
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,440
that is inside the rectangle as well. So

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,350
that things look a little bit consistent.

41
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
So we are going to add the rectangle

42
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:46,330
again. Inside we are going to put a

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:54,580
TextInput element. The ID is going to be

44
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,269
firstName... Text is going to be: "Type in

45
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:07,720
your first name". Why not? And it is going

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,120
to be centered in the parent as well. So

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,040
we're going to say anchors.centerIn,

48
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,820
parent. And it should have the focus so

49
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,140
we should set "focus: true". If you

50
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,510
look at TextInput, let's look at it in

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,420
the documentation. We select it, hit F1. It

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,090
is going to open. In help to the right

53
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,790
here, click on this button on top. Open in

54
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,130
help mode to have it shown in

55
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,709
full-screen. Let's look at all the

56
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,579
members including inherited members. And

57
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,110
if you look down we're going to find a

58
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,380
property called "focus" and this property

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,569
holds whether the item has focused

60
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,569
within the enclosing focused scope, okay?

61
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,380
It basically says if

62
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,570
sytem has focus. We are not going to go

63
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,970
into focus scope by now. We are going to

64
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,510
look at that later in the chapter. But we

65
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,960
have our TextInput now. And we can run

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,340
to see it in action.

67
00:04:04,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Mm-hmm you see that...
