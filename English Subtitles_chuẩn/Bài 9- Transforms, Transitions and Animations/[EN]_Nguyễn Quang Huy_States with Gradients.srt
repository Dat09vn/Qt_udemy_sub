1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
In this lecture we're going to see how

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,929
you can work with gradients within your

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,660
States changes. This is a subject that

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,000
confuses many students so I thought it

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,040
was a good idea to include it as a

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,349
lecture and make things clear a little

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,780
bit. We're going to go to QT creator and

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,910
look at that. We are going to start from

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,010
this state we left the last lecture and

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,109
but I am going to do this as a separate

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,390
project to have been separated nice and

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,130
neat. So I am going to create a new

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,630
project, file - new project,

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,600
it's a QT quick application we call it

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,620
StatesWithGradientsDemo, choose our QT

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,530
version, choose our kit, hit next and

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,309
finish. Let's state what we want to do. I

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,890
am going to go to the last project and

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,199
copy whatever we had in there and use it

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,230
here. The way I do that, I'm going to go

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,110
back there, you should go there in your

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,670
project and copy everything that is

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,170
inside the window element. We should do

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,710
it like this. I think this is correct.

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,380
Let's double check, yes, hit copy we come

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,479
back to the project here, the new one and

27
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,350
we paste in what we had. We also have to

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,180
bring in the resource files otherwise

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,000
we're not going to find the tree.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,360
We're going to go where the last lecture

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,299
is defined click on the file here, the

32
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,790
main file of it - show in Explorer. We find

33
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,710
this folder of images. We're going to

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,729
copy it, close this, come back to our

35
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,119
current project - show in Explorer, the

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,780
same thing really. And we're going to

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,590
paste in this folder of images. Ok we

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,680
have our trees. Now we can add a resource

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,930
file resources - add new - qt - resource file,

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,700
call it resource.

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,920
You want to add your prefix tip, take

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
this out, hit enter, add files. And you're

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,150
going to find the two images here. You

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,650
want to load them, save your thing,

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,990
come back to main.qml. We can

46
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,140
close this actually let's see what thing

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,080
here, close everything because I don't

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,150
want things to confuse me, open my

49
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,550
project again. Okay this is what we have,

50
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,459
we run it we're going to have everything

51
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,760
we had in the last lecture. Okay this is

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,280
what we had. What I want to show you is

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,310
what would happen if you specified, for

54
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,580
example, the color of your sky or the

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,230
ground as a gradient.

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,720
Okay let's comment this out, for example,

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,190
and put in a gradient property like this.

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,650
Gradient is really nothing but a set of

59
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,870
color changes. You want to set the color

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,810
of your gradient for example us going

61
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,269
fluently from one color to another, for

62
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,190
example, from red to blue. You're going to

63
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,959
see what I mean if you run this

64
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,930
application now, let's see what happens.

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,989
Okay you see that the color of the sky

66
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,650
is like this, it's going from dark blue

67
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,620
to a lighter blue. This is what the

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,290
gradient is. So if you want to use this

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,720
in our application we are going to have

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,959
problems if we try to say this States

71
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,540
by passing gradient like this. I'm going

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,920
to show you what I mean. I'm going to put

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
another gradient for the ground. Let's

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,530
comment this out and put in a gradient

75
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,410
and go to our state's in summer. What

76
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,959
many new students do is specify a

77
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,720
gradient like this, okay, like they

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,160
specify a color so they say gradient and

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,780
set it to something like this, for

80
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,360
example, put in another gradient well

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
this is going to be disasters.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,769
Let's run. Your application is not even

83
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,930
going to run because there are

84
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,830
components

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,189
that are going to fail to load. This is a

86
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,460
bad syntax and it can be confusing for

87
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,069
many students if they do this. So the way

88
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,169
you do this, you shouldn't pass a

89
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,479
full-blown gradient component like this.

90
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,240
You should look at the gradient, you see

91
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,389
that it has an ID okay and it has

92
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,969
properties so you can actually target

93
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:49,210
this thing and change its color. Okay so

94
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,009
what you should do is not do something

95
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,360
like this, we're going to comment this

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,530
out. Instead you would do a separate

97
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,110
property change that targets the

98
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,500
gradient ctrl+a crtl+i to align.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,110
You see that we are targeting the start

100
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,919
color of the sky and we are changing

101
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,440
this to the color that we want. And we

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,539
could do the same thing for the sky end

103
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,960
color crtl+a crtl+i to align.

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,199
Then we animate the changing of the

105
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,330
start color and the end color in our

106
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,139
gradient. Okay this is how you should do

107
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,690
it when you want to pass in States

108
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,449
changes from your gradient. We're going

109
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,050
to do the same in the spring actually

110
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,990
the changes we did here are for spring.

111
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,199
So we're going to copy them here, I'm

112
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,479
sorry for that if this confuses you.

113
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,039
We're going to put this in spring and on

114
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,960
top here we are going to do for summer

115
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,839
and in summer it's going to be like this

116
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,629
crtl+a crtl+i. It's nothing new

117
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,000
really we are just changing the colors

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,690
here let's run and see what we get. This

119
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,629
guy should animate correctly now. You see

120
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,969
that we see our thing here. We are seeing

121
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,669
a gradient on the ground and on the sky

122
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,879
and if we click you see that the sky

123
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,389
color changes fluidly. This is what we

124
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,690
want and it is a gradient and it adds a

125
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,300
little bit of light to your scene here. I

126
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,819
don't know if you can see that. So we're

127
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,190
going to do the same for the ground. So

128
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,940
in summer,

129
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,300
the ground is going to change till, we

130
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,979
want to take out the color because

131
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,979
that's not what we are changing, we

132
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,480
comment this out

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,540
and we put an gradient that changes the

134
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,230
ground color crtl+a crtl+i. This is

135
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,230
what we want in summer, we should do the

136
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,310
same thing in spring. Let's go down find

137
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,490
ground, we should take this out because

138
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,640
we are not changing the colors we are

139
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,770
changing the gradients crtl+a crtl+i

140
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,060
to align. And we change the ground

141
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,770
gradient like this, we change the start

142
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,250
color and the end color.

143
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,660
Let's run you see that the ground also

144
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,270
is changing accordingly following the

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,550
gradients that we said. And this is

146
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,380
really all I wanted to show you in this

147
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,720
lecture. If you want to pass gradient

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,000
changes in your property changes you

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,920
shouldn't do it like this, this is not

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,290
going to work, your application is not

151
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,870
even going to run. Instead you should

152
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,690
specify your gradients like this give

153
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,380
gradientstop an ID and target these

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,140
IDs to change the colors this is how you

155
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,570
do it. This is all for this lecture. In

156
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,520
the next chapter we are actually going

157
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,860
to start working with networking in

158
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,900
qml and we are going to do fun

159
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,110
stuff like fetching REST API and using

160
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,570
them in our qt quick applications. I'll see

161
00:07:55,570 --> 00:00:00,000
you there
