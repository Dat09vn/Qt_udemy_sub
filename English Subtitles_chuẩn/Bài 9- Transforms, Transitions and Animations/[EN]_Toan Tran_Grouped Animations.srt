1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
In this lecture, we're going to see

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,680
how you can group your animations using

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,420
ParallelAnimations or SequentialAnimation.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,730
We're going to go to Qt Creator and play with this.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,250
Here we are in Qt Creator.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,170
We're going to create our project.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,830
It's a Qt Quick Application.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,350
We call it 'GroupedAnimationsDemo'.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,650
We save it in the usual location,

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,800
choose our Qt Version, choose our kit and finish.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,630
We want to change the title here to say 'Grouped Animations Demo'.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,649
We want to give it an ID and

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:44,149
define a 'property' for 'animationDuration'.

14
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,270
It's going to start at 500. Inside we

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,480
want to have a 'Rectangle'. Let's put some space here.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,550
We wanted to 'fill' the 'parent'

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,649
and we want its 'color' to be 'gray'.

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,400
Inside we have another 'Rectangle'. Its ID

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,640
is going to be 'circleId', because we want

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,100
this to be a circle, 'width' is going to be

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,659
100, 'height' is going to be 100. And its

22
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,330
'radius', we're going to make it big enough

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,430
to make it a circle, so I'm going to put

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,420
in 70 here. And its 'color' is going to be

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,930
'yellowgreen'. Why not? Now we want to

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,240
animate it. What we want to animate is

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,079
its X position and its Y position and we

28
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,890
want to wrap those animations in either

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,710
a parallel animation or a sequential

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,649
animation. These animations are exactly

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,610
what they sound like.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,770
Parallel animations make your

33
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,110
animations happen at the same time in

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,649
parallel and sequential animations make

35
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,500
them run one after another. We're going

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,500
to start by SequentialAnimation. We're

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,110
going to give it an ID. This will do. And

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,479
it's going to contain two

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,110
NumberAnimation.

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,159
You want to do it like this. We want to

41
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,920
make them standalone for the first one.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,349
The 'target' is going to be 'circleId', the

43
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:34,889
'property' is going to be "X". It is going to

44
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:43,049
animate 'to' 'rootId.width - width'. It's

45
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,120
going to start 'from' 0 and the

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,250
'duration' is going to be 'animationDuration', 

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,220
that we specified at the start

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,739
of this lecture here. The properties are

49
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,590
really going to be the same for the

50
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,719
other animations. So we're going to copy

51
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,689
this and put that here and we should

52
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,849
flag here that we want to animate X.

53
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,950
This is better for readability if we

54
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,599
come back to look at this piece of code

55
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:20,400
later. We want to animate 'circleId', the

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,139
'property' is going to be "Y". We're going to

57
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:37,169
animate 'to' 'rootId.height - height' and it should

58
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:42,030
start at 0. This is what we want and when

59
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,340
we click in this parent rectangle here,

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,129
we want to start the animation. So we

61
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,650
should put our MouseArea inside, it's

62
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,850
going to 'fill' the 'parent'

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,460
and when it is clicked, we want to reset

64
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:12,900
the values and animation. So we say 'circleId'.

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,970
Because X and Y might have been changed

66
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,890
by the animation, we want to reset that

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,680
to zero. So we say 'circleId.x' equals zero,

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,100
'circleId.y' equals zero. This is how we

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,410
reset and we want to start this

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,570
SequentialAnimation here. I actually

71
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,300
think this ID is not adequate, so I'm

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,810
going to change this to 'groupedAnimId'

73
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,040
and the way you start the animation is

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,420
the usual thing really. You say

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,350
'groupedAnimId.start()' and we should have our

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,960
animation running. Notice that it is a

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,090
SequentialAnimation that we had here,

78
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,480
and inside we are animating X and we are

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
animating Y. So what is going to happen?

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,460
Our circle here is going to move from

81
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,770
left to right and then it's going to

82
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,650
move from top to bottom and all that is

83
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,630
going to happen in this time 'duration' here.

84
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,000
Now we can run the application.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,470
Ok you see we have our 'yellowgreen'

86
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,190
rectangle, we click, nothing happens.

87
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,280
Why is that? Why is that? Let's go back to our

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,630
MouseArea and if you look, we made a

89
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,870
small mistake. The 'to' location should be

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,780
in relation to the 'circleId' so we

91
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,690
shouldn't say - 'width' here we should say

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:50,170
'circleId.width'. Let's correct that.

93
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,870
Ok, 'circleId.width' and 'circleId.height' here.

94
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,630
It is easy to make mistakes like this.

95
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,330
Let's run.

96
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,320
If we click in the gray area, you see

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,840
that it goes from left to right and then

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,990
from top to bottom. This is what we want

99
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,930
and if you notice, I put a debug

100
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,140
statement in here to just know that I

101
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,270
clicked in the MouseArea. I love to have

102
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,970
my develop formation. You can check it

103
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,640
out if you want. It is this line here.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,300
Okay this is a SequentialAnimation.

105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,490
If we want it, we will do that in parallel.

106
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,400
So we can actually comment this out

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,310
This is going to be messy but it's going to

108
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,750
remind you that you can do sequential

109
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,790
and parallel animation. So we're going to

110
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,950
say 'ParallelAnimation' and put a

111
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,020
brackets like this. So we change the

112
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,880
SequentialAnimation to a ParallelAnimation 

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,950
and if you want to switch, you

114
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,960
can just uncomment and comment the other.

115
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,620
We're going to run the application and I

116
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,180
will try to guess what's going to happen.

117
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,390
Our animation is going to happen at the

118
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,460
same time. It is moving from left to

119
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,440
right and from top to bottom at the same time.

120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,300
That's why you see it move like this,

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,720
along this diagonal line.

122
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
This is what we have. This is really all

123
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
to working with sequential and parallel

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,650
animation. But before we wrap up this lecture,

125
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,360
I would like to show you a

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,210
little bit about easing and overshoots.

127
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,660
I'm going to go to this Y animation here,

128
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,490
and I'm going to set an 'easing.type', it's

129
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:44,220
going to be 'Easing.OutBounce' and the

130
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,770
amplitude, we can set the amplitude for this thing.

131
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,280
Let's make that 3.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,810
Run the application and see what it looks like.

133
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,640
If you run you see that

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,130
it looks like a bouncing ball and this is

135
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,110
one of the effects you can achieve using easing.

136
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,680
This is cool. Right? Okay this is

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
all we have for this lecture and the

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
next one we're going to do a demo and

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,370
animate a ball falling from the top.

140
00:08:14,370 --> 00:00:00,000
 I'll see you there.
