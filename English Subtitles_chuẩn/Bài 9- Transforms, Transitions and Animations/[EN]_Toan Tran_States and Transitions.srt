00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,709
In this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,770
states and transitions. A state is a

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,230
group of properties that can be applied

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,750
to your element. For example, if you look

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,000
at the scene here, this can be a summer state.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,079
The Sun is this color, the sky is

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,570
this color, the tree is this color and

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,630
the ground is this color. And when we

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,900
change to spring, we have another set of

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,180
properties that are grouped in a state

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,849
that we call spring. I hope this makes sense.

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,930
A state is a group of properties.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,790
A transition is how you go from one state

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,090
to another fluidly. Okay if you look, the

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,219
changes are fluid. We are not jumping

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,250
from color to color. There is some kind

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,590
of fluidity and the way we change from

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,440
one state to another. This is basically

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,000
what we are going to look at in this

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,160
lecture. And we are going to work a

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
project like this, to explore this. So, we

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,629
are going to start our project. File, New,

23
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,300
Application, it's a Qt Quick Application project.

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,720
We call it 'StatesAndTransitionsDemo',

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,590
hit next, choose your Qt Version, choose your kit,

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:19,070
and we are done. We should say 'States and Transitions Demo'.

27
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,840
And we are going to put our components.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,170
We need a sky, a ground,

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,900
a tree and a sun. We are going to start

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,500
by putting in a 'Rectangle'. Its 'id' is going

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,500
to be 'containerRectId'. It is going to 'fill' the 'parent'.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,369
We are going to put in our sky.

33
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,909
Let's align things correctly.

34
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,880
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I. It really is nothing fancy.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,310
It's just a 'Rectangle' with an ID, a width,

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,070
a height and a color. We put in our ground.

37
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,180
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align.

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,869
Our ground is also the same but it is

39
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,860
anchored to the bottom of the sky and it

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,470
stretches up to the bottom of the window.

41
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,650
It has a width,

42
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,049
the same as the parent and it

43
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,140
has this color. Next, we want to put in our

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,579
tree. All trees really, because we are

45
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:25,079
going to implement this as two trees and

46
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,239
depending on the state, we are in, we are

47
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,459
going to hide one and show the other.

48
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,129
We have a spring tree and a summer tree and

49
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,680
we should add them in our resource file.

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,079
So we are going to 'Add new', 'Qt', 'Qt Resource File',

51
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,260
we call this 'resource' as usual.

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,549
We are going to go where this link

53
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:56,019
is stored, Show in Explorer. Ok our folder

54
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,780
is here. We want to create an 'images'

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,590
folder. Open it and put in our images. You

56
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,900
see that there are two images: one is for

57
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,170
spring, the other is for summer. You can

58
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,239
use these images in your project. No

59
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,980
problem. We're going to come back to our

60
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,079
project here. We're going to add a

61
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,829
'Prefix', we take it out, hit enter. We

62
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,299
add files and we select our folder and

63
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,169
select our images. We save this and our

64
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,129
images should now be recognisable. The

65
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,590
last component is the Sun. So we should

66
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,280
put it in here. Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align. It

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,250
has a width and height of 100. It is at

68
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,519
this position by default. So it is in the

69
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,750
right side of the canvas and it is on Y 50.

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,079
It is yellow, it is a circle. That's

71
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,900
why we made the radius very big. Right

72
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,120
now we can run our application and see

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,169
how it looks.

74
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,799
We haven't applied any states so it

75
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,030
should look like this.

76
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,889
You see that we are seeing the summer

77
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,190
tree. Why is that? We are seeing the

78
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,979
summer tree because we put it last and

79
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,190
it is being staffed on top of the spring tree.

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,070
So what we want to do is to define

81
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,918
our states. So the way you define your

82
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,270
states, you say 'states'

83
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,790
like this and you put in an array that

84
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,540
is going to be your state. Okay inside,

85
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,880
you can say 'State' and it's going to be

86
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,310
your state here and you like to separate

87
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,730
them by a comma like this and say 'State'

88
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,190
again. We want to have two states so we

89
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,600
put in two here, summer and spring. So we

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,910
should give them names like this, so we

91
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,340
can give your state a name: the first one

92
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,340
is going to be "summer", the second one is

93
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:05,730
going to be "spring" and we should specify

94
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,550
how our set of properties are going to

95
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,510
change to go in this state. For that we

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,630
use a PropertyChange component,

97
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,740
the 'target' is going to be the 'sky',

98
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,630
we are going to start by the sky and

99
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,510
the color is going to change to deep sky

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,630
blue. No, in summer the sky should be

101
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,040
light blue. The summer tree should be

102
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,580
visible and the spring tree should be

103
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,920
invisible. So we make the opacity for the

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,950
summer tree 1 and the opacity for the

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,130
spring tree 0. This is how we show one

106
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,350
and hide the other. This is a trick you

107
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,960
should learn. It comes in handy many

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
times. The ground is going to change to be

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,410
dark khaki and the Sun should turn

110
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,490
yellow. Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align. So we

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,580
have our properties in place for the

112
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,340
summer state. We should also do the

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,700
spring state. In spring, the sky should

114
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,240
turn deep sky blue. We should hide the

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,280
summer tree and show the spring tree

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,590
which is what we have here. Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align.

117
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,960
So that things are

118
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,530
visible. The summer tree opacity is zero so

119
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,350
it is invisible, the spring tree opacity

120
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,320
is 1 so it is visible. The ground should

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,030
turn to this color, a 'lime'.

122
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,180
And the sun should turn light yellow.

123
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,759
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align.

124
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,580
And this is how the sun is going to look and

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,110
we want to start in this summer state.

126
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,550
Okay so we should come here and say

127
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,650
'state' "summer" and right now we have our

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,949
state defined. We set our default state.

129
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,479
We should run to see what our

130
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,360
application looks like. Okay you see that

131
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,630
we start in summer. The ground looks like

132
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,850
this. We have a summer tree and the sun

133
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,740
looks like this. Let's go back to our

134
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,199
application and change to spring. Run the

135
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,039
application. And you see that we turn the

136
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,520
colors to look like in spring. Now we

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,800
want to automate the changes from one

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,020
state to another. We are going to put in

139
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,870
a MouseArea that is going to fill the

140
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,990
container rectangle. Let's go to its

141
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,460
bottom right here, put in a MouseArea,

142
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:54,889
'anchors.fill' 'parent', onClicked and we

143
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,630
are going to say 'containerRectId.state'.

144
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,479
the state of the container rect is going to

145
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,580
be equal to the expression that we are

146
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,750
going to put in here. So if this state

147
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,169
equals 'spring', we are going to set this

148
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,159
state to 'summer', otherwise we are going

149
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,810
to set that to 'spring'. This is what this

150
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,300
expression says here. And if this doesn't

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,159
make sense, you should check your a

152
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,539
ternary operation knowledge by some

153
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,120
JavaScript tutorial. It is really easy we

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,419
are saying if the state equals 'spring',

155
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,729
set the state here to 'summer', if it is

156
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,900
not equal to 'spring', set this to 'spring'.

157
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,310
Let's run the application and we should

158
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,510
be able to toggle

159
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,520
between states and you see that the

160
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,590
changes are really great. We are

161
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,260
jumping from one state to another and it

162
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,170
should really help if we could make the

163
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,140
changes fluid when we go from one state

164
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,570
to another. And that's when transitions

165
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,910
come in. Transitions allow you to make

166
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,630
the changes in states fluid. Let me show

167
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,280
you what I mean. I'm going to go back to

168
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,800
our application and put in a transition.

169
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,220
The syntax really looks like the states

170
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,380
so we're going to say 'Transitions' here

171
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:31,430
and 'States' on top here. Let's go back to

172
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,920
transitions and say 'transitions'. You see

173
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,470
that we have a property of transitions

174
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,520
down here and put in an array like this.

175
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,350
Inside we want to put a set of

176
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:54,880
transitions. We want to go 'from' "summer" 'to'

177
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:02,240
"spring". The color changes are going to be

178
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
animated. Okay because we are changing

179
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,680
colors a lot. You're going to put in a

180
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,100
'duration' of 500 for example and we

181
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,400
should say NumberAnimation also. The

182
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,300
'property' that is going to change is

183
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,480
'opacity'. The 'duration' is also going to be

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,950
500. Okay, from summer to spring we are

185
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,370
going to animate like this. If we run the

186
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,090
application, okay, we are in spring. If we

187
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,220
go to summer, you see that the change is

188
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,800
crisp, it's very fast, there is no

189
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
animation. But if we go from summer to

190
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,990
spring, you see that it is animated. Okay

191
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,420
this is how you can animate from one

192
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,210
state to another. We also want to animate

193
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,640
from spring to summer. We should

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,300
basically say the same thing. Put in a

195
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,760
transition.

196
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,750
We're going to copy this transition, put

197
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,850
a comma here to separate them and put

198
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,580
another one. This one is going to be from

199
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,910
spring to summer and it basically is

200
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,590
going to be the same thing.

201
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,560
Okay, our changes are animated now from one

202
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,040
state to another. This is how you do it.

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,530
So if you don't want to separate this

204
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,160
things, if the animations are the same no

205
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,620
matter your direction, no matter if you

206
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,510
are going from summer to spring or

207
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,030
spring to summer, we can actually comment

208
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,790
this out. Let's comment this out and show

209
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,370
you another way you can do this. That is

210
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,980
easier and more readable if you want to

211
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,470
do the exact same thing like this. We can

212
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,440
say 'transitions' and pass in one

213
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:09,820
'Transition' and say 'from' any state 'to' any

214
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,180
state. We are going to do these

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,960
animations: ColorAnimation and NumberAnimation.

216
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,260
We should put in our colon here,

217
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,120
and put a semicolon in here to make

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,600
thing

219
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,570
pass the syntax check. And we are going

220
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,240
to put in our usual animation here.

221
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
ColorAnimation and NumberAnimation on

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,940
opacity. This is how you can pass

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,880
transitions to your animation. It is

224
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,220
going to work the same but now we have

225
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,410
one transition that is targeting

226
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,830
everything from any state to any state.

227
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,080
And this is really all that is to

228
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,750
working with states and transitions.

229
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,840
A state is a set of properties and you can

230
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,930
pass from one stage to another, just like

231
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,350
we did here, just by setting the stage.

232
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,600
The default state for our case here was

233
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,730
spring. And we are able to switch between

234
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,370
spring and summer. And this is how you

235
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,500
specify the properties for your state.

236
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,899
And these are the different

237
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,300
syntaxes that you can use to pass from

238
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,790
one state to another with an animation

239
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,209
specified within your transition

240
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,879
component here. This is all for this

241
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,499
lecture. In the next one, we're going to

242
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,809
show you how you can work with gradients

243
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,420
in your state and transitions.

244
00:13:34,420 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there.
