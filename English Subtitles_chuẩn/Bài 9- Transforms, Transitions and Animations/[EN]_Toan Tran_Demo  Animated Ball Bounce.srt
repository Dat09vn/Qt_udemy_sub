1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
In this lecture, we're going to do an

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,100
animated ball bounce. This is going to be

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,560
a slightly different demo that we're

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,719
going to be doing. Because I am going to

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,179
show you a reference that is very good

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,639
to learn about QML. We're going to find a

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,619
good example inside and we're going to

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,960
run it. I think this is a good way to let

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,199
you know of ways you can find things you

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,630
don't know yet. Okay, the reference, I was

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,300
talking about, is this book here. It is a

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,910
book that is available online. It is

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,390
called

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,420
'A book about Qt5'. It is contributed by

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,420
some people. It is open source. It has an

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,489
open license, you can read it or you can

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,710
even contribute to it if you happen to

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,960
have things to add to it. I'm going to

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,090
let you read on all these things if you

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,739
want. So what we want to do is to go in

21
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,730
chapter 5 on 'Fluid elements' and we want

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,969
to look at 'Animations'. And you see that

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,100
they also talk about easing curves. They

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,680
give you a good lecture about them. You

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,589
can really look at this. So let's scroll

26
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,549
down find our thing and we want to look at

27
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,710
'Grouped Animations'. You see that they

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,560
show how you can animate things. This is

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,060
basically what we did in the last

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,180
lecture. A SequentialAnimation, you move

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,810
on Y and on X and the ParallelAnimation

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,840
where it happens at the same time. But

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,850
this is not what we want. We want to do

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,340
this thing here, a bouncing ball. So we're

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,200
going to read this together and create a

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Qt project to play with it.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
So, grouped animation can also be nested 

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,619
for example, a sequential animation can have

39
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,920
two parallel animations as child

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,799
animations and so on.

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,470
Okay so animations can be nested. We can

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,090
visualise this with the soccer ball

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,119
example. The idea is to throw a ball from

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,619
left to right and animate its behaviour.

45
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,360
Ok, this is what we want to do.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,070
To understand the animation, we are going to

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,549
break this into three parts. We are going

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,969
to animate on X from left to right, we

49
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,580
are going to animate on Y1 the ball going

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,090
up, we are going to animate on Y2 the ball

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,330
going down,

52
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,310
and we are going to apply some bouncing

53
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,130
on this when the ball goes down, and we

54
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,140
are going to rotate the ball over the

55
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,050
entire animation. And they try to depict

56
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,820
what we are doing here. We are going to

57
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,460
animate on Y, we are going to start by

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,740
animating on Y , we are going to go

59
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,610
down and over all this period we are

60
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,070
going to be rotating and moving in X.

61
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,890
Let's go to Qt Creator, start a project

62
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,740
and follow up with us. Okay here we are

63
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,870
in Qt Creator, we are going to create our

64
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,740
project.

65
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,450
It's a Qt Quick Application. We call it

66
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,470
'AnimatedBallBounceDemo', save it in the

67
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,890
usual location, choose a Qt Version,

68
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,470
choose our kit and finish. We are going

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,740
to do everything in our 'main.qml' file.

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,230
We're going to skip this. This is kind of

71
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,209
a container for everything you are going to do.

72
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,640
The next step would be to add the

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
background, which is in our case two

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,630
rectangles with the green and blue

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,540
gradients. Okay we are basically going to

76
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,090
put in this. The first rectangle is this 'sky'.

77
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,510
It has a gradient. A gradient is

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,550
really a translation from different

79
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,510
colors. Okay you see this blue, start out

80
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,110
a little bit darker and it goes bright

81
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,570
as we go down and the same thing happens

82
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,080
to the green it starts out light and it

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,660
goes dark. So we're going to copy our

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,940
rectangle here and I think we should

85
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,480
actually copy all these, bring them back

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,680
in our example here. This is good

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,110
practice to copy and paste in your

88
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,480
projects and learn how to insert them.

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,360
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align. We have our background. The sky

90
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,880
is going to be this gradient. The ground

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,610
is going to be this gradient. And you see

92
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,420
that the ground is anchored to the bottom

93
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,649
of the sky and it is to touch the

94
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,228
bottom of the window. We can actually run

95
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,940
the application we have right now and

96
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,380
see how it looks.

97
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's run you see that

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,940
our ground is not working. So, what is the

99
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,020
problem? We want to anchor the rectangle

100
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,000
for the ground to the bottom of the

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,770
parent so we should change this to

102
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,310
'parent.bottom'. This is better. Let's run

103
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,880
to see what we have now. Okay you see

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,100
that we have our sky and the ground

105
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,770
which is green. The upper rectangle is

106
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,220
going to take 200 pixel of the height

107
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,320
and the lower one is going to take the

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,370
remaining height.

109
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,190
Let's bring the soccer ball on the

110
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,380
canvas. The ball is an image stored under

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,930
"assets/soccer_ball.png'. For the beginning, we

112
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,970
would like to position it in the lower

113
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,060
left corner, near the edge. Okay it's going to

114
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,550
start out here. So what we're going to do is

115
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,550
basically bring in this image here, come

116
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,110
back to our project. We put it below the

117
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,450
second rectangle, the ground one. We want

118
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,970
to add a resource file that is going to

119
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,420
contain this image here. So I am going to

120
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,040
come here 'Resources', add new,

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:40,330
Qt resource file, we call it 'resource'. 

122
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,630
This is done. We go back to where our project is stored.

123
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,410
That should be here. We want to

124
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,640
add the new directory called 'images' and

125
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,160
I want to open the directory and put in

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,310
my image of the ball. So if you don't

127
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,950
have this ball, you can come back to this

128
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,680
book here. I want to go to the start of

129
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,780
it and you're going to see that you can

130
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,300
find the chapter examples in the assets

131
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,750
folder. We are in chapter 5 so we should

132
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,970
look for chapter 5. Let's look at that.

133
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,640
You should download chapter 5 here and

134
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,860
you're going to extract this and find

135
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,140
the balls and the examples that you need.

136
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,260
So put that in your images folder like

137
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,630
this or you can even copy this image

138
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,510
from the project that I provided with

139
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,210
the course here. We're going to close

140
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,460
this because we don't need it anymore.

141
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,030
We're going to add a 'Prefix', take it out

142
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,229
because we don't want it, add file,

143
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,960
'images', we choose 'soccerball'. Notice the

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,810
name here, 'soccerball.png'. We save,

145
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,050
we come back here and we change this to

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,629
'images/soccerball.png'. You see that

147
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,449
it is recognised and you see that they

148
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,999
are saying 'root' here so we should define

149
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,659
this 'root' to be this window, because it

150
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,379
is parent. So it should say 'root' here.

151
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,050
So, it is going to be to the left bottom

152
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,039
because X is going to be 0 and the

153
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,169
height is going to be the height of the

154
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,960
parent which is this 'root' window here

155
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,189
minus the height of the ball. And when we

156
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,259
click, we are going to reset its X

157
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,529
position, its Y position, its rotation and

158
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,900
we are going to start the animation.

159
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,819
This is not defined yet so you can safely

160
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,599
ignore it now. We can actually comment

161
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,089
this out. We don't want it to influence

162
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,639
what we have. Let's run to see that we

163
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,580
have our ball in the correct location.

164
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,610
mm-hmm... We have our ball here. This is

165
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,159
good and right. Ok we have our image in

166
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,469
place. This is what we should have.

167
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,509
The image has a mouse area attached to it.

168
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,000
If the ball is clicked the position of the

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,009
ball will reset and the animation

170
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,219
restart. Let's start with a sequential

171
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,099
animation for the 2 Y transitions.

172
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:12,849
So, they put an a SequentialAnimation

173
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,379
to animate the ball to go up and go down.

174
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,279
Ok, it is going to animate 'to' 20 and its

175
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,120
going to animate back 'to' 240 and the

176
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,020
'duration' is going to be 0.4 and 0.6.

177
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,760
Let's copy this and put this in our

178
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,059
project. You should put that below the

179
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,360
image. This would work. So we have

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,448
SequentialAnimation. Ok the ball is

181
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,399
going to animate upwards and it's going

182
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,160
to animate downwards and you see that

183
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
40% of the time is going to be used upwards

184
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,519
and 60% of the time is going to be used

185
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,010
downwards. So we should define this

186
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,860
duration here. Let's go up. I don't think

187
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,760
we defined it.

188
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,630
Let's do 'property' 'int' call this 'duration'

189
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,529
and it is going to be one second (1000).

190
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,720
They said three seconds in the book but

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,670
I like to do one. You can do whatever you

192
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,370
want. And we took this chance to change

193
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,660
this thing. This should do. You should go

194
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,720
down now and uncomment this thing here.

195
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,360
Okay I hope you are seeing the process

196
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,070
you can go through to design something fun.

197
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,110
Let's run. The animation is going to

198
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,000
restart and we are going to see the ball

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,449
go up and down. Okay

200
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,170
that's what happens.

201
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,240
Now what we want is to put in the edge

202
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,170
and rotation animation. Let's go back to

203
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,380
the book. Next we need to add the X-translation.

204
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,779
The X-translation shall run

205
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,370
in parallel with the Y-translation

206
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,459
so we need to encapsulate the sequence

207
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,069
of Y-translations into a parallel

208
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,630
animation together with the X-translation.

209
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,459
So this is what we're going

210
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,920
to do. This is a SequentialAnimation

211
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,829
that we have. We are going to wrap that

212
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,690
into a ParallelAnimation and we're

213
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,269
going to add a NumberAnimation that is

214
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,000
going to animate the ball on the X

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,240
coordinate. Let's put in our parallel

216
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,000
animation. The 'id' is going to be 'anim'

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,019
and it is going to contain this

218
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,490
SequentialAnimation that we have here.

219
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,899
Let's take it out, put it in, take out this

220
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,290
'id' because we don't want it anymore.

221
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,540
But down here we want to put another

222
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,810
NumberAnimation and

223
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,240
the NumberAnimation is going to be what we have

224
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,779
here.

225
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,680
So we copied this and put that in here.

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,790
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I to align. So we are

227
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,170
animating the ball,

228
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,500
we are animating on X, it is going to

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,350
animate up 'to' 400 and the 'duration' is

230
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,899
going to be the duration that we have

231
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,839
here. Let's run the application and when

232
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,120
we start, we are starting the parallel

233
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,009
animation and things are going to happen

234
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,439
at the same time. You see that the ball

235
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,860
animates from left to right. We are

236
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,589
making some progress. Right? Okay this is

237
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,149
what we have. At the end we would like

238
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,790
the ball to be rotating. For this we need

239
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,740
to add another animation to the parallel

240
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,050
animation. We chose the RotationAnimation

241
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,600
because it is specialized for

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,170
rotation. Our RotatioAnnimation is going

243
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,720
to be like this. It is going to happen

244
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,209
all along from start to finish.

245
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,089
'target' is going to be 'ball' and it is

246
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,540
going to rotate up to this angle here.

247
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,769
Let's put that

248
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,189
in our project. It's going to be below

249
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,559
NumberAnimation because it needs to be

250
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,290
included in the ParallelAnimation here.

251
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,670
This is what we have.

252
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:26,069
Let's run. Okay, as we go, we are rotating.

253
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:29,379
We are having something more similar to

254
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:32,019
what we want. We should go back to the

255
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,709
book and see the next step. That's the

256
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,389
whole animation sequence. The one thing

257
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,670
left is to provide the correct easing

258
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,610
curves for the movements of the ball. For

259
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,239
Y1 animation I use 'Easing.OutCirc' curve as

260
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,369
this should look more like a circular

261
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:52,779
movement. Y2 is enhanced with Easing.OutBounce

262
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,239
as the ball should bounce at the end.

263
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:58,299
Okay the ball should bounce as we

264
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,360
end the animation. So what they did, they

265
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,379
put easing.type to when the ball is

266
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:11,759
going up and it is Easing.OutCirc.

267
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,379
When the ball is going up, we... ease OutCirc.

268
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,279
This is our animation here. Let's go back

269
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,449
to the book. When we go down, we.. ease OutBounce.

270
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:31,540
Let's go back to our code and use that.

271
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,980
Let's look at the book again and

272
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,259
see what we have. We don't have anything

273
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,769
else. This is really all. Let's come to

274
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:48,699
the project, run it and when you click,

275
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:52,179
you have a ball doing a bouncing

276
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,189
movement here. And ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:56,199
this is what we had to do in this

278
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,509
lecture. I hope you enjoyed it. The most

279
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,019
important thing is to see that you can

280
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:05,049
use this book here to learn a few things

281
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,809
that you might want to know, that I

282
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,239
didn't have a chance to cover. It is very

283
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,970
rich in content. They talk about more

284
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,189
things than I could cover in this course.

285
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,540
You see they talk about multimedia, the

286
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,400
talk about shader effects, they talk

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,770
about the canvas element. These are all

288
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,530
very interesting topics and you should

289
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,480
refer to this book when you are done

290
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,550
with this course. I think you are going

291
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,220
to have enough ground to read it and

292
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,920
understand it. Okay this is all I had for

293
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,720
this lecture. And the next one we're

294
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,490
going to look at states and transitions

295
00:14:38,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you there
