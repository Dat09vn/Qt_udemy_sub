0:00:00.000,0:00:04.009
In this chapter, we are going to look at

0:00:01.620,0:00:06.660
transforms, transitions and animations.

0:00:04.009,0:00:09.059
This is a very interesting

0:00:06.660,0:00:11.580
and rich topic into amount

0:00:09.059,0:00:13.950
because it really brings your user interface to life.

0:00:11.580,0:00:16.379
We are going to touch on transforms,

0:00:13.950,0:00:19.020
which are a set of changes that you can apply

0:00:16.379,0:00:22.080
to your QML elements.

0:00:19.020,0:00:24.660
You can do translations which are a way to move

0:00:22.080,0:00:27.539
your elements on the x-axis or the y-axis.

0:00:24.660,0:00:29.490
You can see on the left here.

0:00:27.539,0:00:33.030
We have the starting position of Qt text here,

0:00:29.490,0:00:36.000
It is to the top left

0:00:33.030,0:00:38.280
and we translated it to be in the middle of the rectangle here.

0:00:36.000,0:00:40.710
It's given distance on the x-axis,

0:00:38.280,0:00:43.649
and it's given distance on the y-axis.

0:00:40.710,0:00:45.629
Rotation is exactly what it sounds like.

0:00:43.649,0:00:48.660
It allows you to rotate your elements.

0:00:45.629,0:00:51.809
You see that it was in the centre

0:00:48.660,0:00:54.840
on the first state here but now

0:00:51.809,0:00:57.000
we rotate it a given angle.

0:00:54.840,0:00:59.489
This is what rotation does and we are going to have a

0:00:57.000,0:01:01.670
chance to play with it. We are also going

0:00:59.489,0:01:04.920
to look at scaling and see how you can

0:01:01.670,0:01:07.920
expand your QML elements or shrink them down in size.

0:01:04.920,0:01:10.080
Animations are a way for you

0:01:07.920,0:01:12.450
to specify the starting state of

0:01:10.080,0:01:15.090
your QML element and the ending state

0:01:12.450,0:01:17.520
and you let the system fill the intermediary steps .

0:01:15.090,0:01:20.159
Let me show you what I mean.

0:01:17.520,0:01:21.930
We have a rectangle here to the left

0:01:20.159,0:01:24.659
and we wanted to move to the right.

0:01:21.930,0:01:27.990
We specify the starting position to be

0:01:24.659,0:01:30.930
the left of the window here and the

0:01:27.990,0:01:33.659
ending position is the right of the window here.

0:01:30.930,0:01:36.810
Notice what happens when we touch it.

0:01:33.659,0:01:38.820
It goes fully way from left

0:01:36.810,0:01:41.189
to right. And this is exactly what

0:01:38.820,0:01:43.560
animations allow you to do.

0:01:41.189,0:01:46.439
There is a good number of animation types that you

0:01:43.560,0:01:48.149
can use in QML. The parent of the

0:01:46.439,0:01:51.060
animations, that we're going to use, is

0:01:48.149,0:01:53.310
PropertyAnimation, which can virtually

0:01:51.060,0:01:55.860
allow you to animate any property in QML.

0:01:53.310,0:01:58.770
We also have a number of

0:01:55.860,0:02:00.960
specialised animations that are designed

0:01:58.770,0:02:03.240
to fit a particular purpose. We have

0:02:00.960,0:02:05.700
NumberAnimation, ColorAnimation,

0:02:03.240,0:02:07.680
RotationAnimation and Vector3dAnimation.

0:02:05.700,0:02:09.569
We are going to have a chance

0:02:07.680,0:02:12.599
to look at the few of these animations.

0:02:09.569,0:02:15.780
We are also going to look at how you can group

0:02:12.599,0:02:18.329
your animations and make them run in a

0:02:15.780,0:02:21.510
sequence using SequentialAnimation or

0:02:18.329,0:02:24.329
make them run in parallel using the ParallelAnimation QML type.

0:02:21.510,0:02:26.340
There is a number of

0:02:24.329,0:02:29.040
methods, properties and signals

0:02:26.340,0:02:31.439
that we can use to control how our

0:02:29.040,0:02:33.569
animations are running. You also want to

0:02:31.439,0:02:36.540
understand a bit about Easings

0:02:33.569,0:02:38.909
which are different ways your animation can happen.

0:02:36.540,0:02:41.819
For example, we saw an example

0:02:38.909,0:02:45.450
of a rectangle moving from left to right.

0:02:41.819,0:02:47.310
If you use a Linear Easing, it's going to

0:02:45.450,0:02:50.310
go linear, it's going to go at a constant speed.

0:02:47.310,0:02:53.370
If you use InQuad, it's going to

0:02:50.310,0:02:55.739
start out slow and end fast.

0:02:53.370,0:02:57.449
We can actually bring up that example and show

0:02:55.739,0:03:00.299
you again what these things are about.

0:02:57.449,0:03:02.989
Okay we have the example here.

0:03:00.299,0:03:06.840
You see: linear, it goes at constant speed.

0:03:02.989,0:03:09.060
InQuad, it starts slow and ends fast.

0:03:06.840,0:03:11.219
I don't know if the recording software can

0:03:09.060,0:03:12.569
capture that. But this is what you see

0:03:11.219,0:03:14.879
and you're going to have a chance to

0:03:12.569,0:03:18.299
write this application in this chapter.

0:03:14.879,0:03:20.099
And the list goes on on the types of Easings

0:03:18.299,0:03:22.650
that you can use in your animations in QML. 

0:03:20.099,0:03:24.870
We're going

0:03:22.650,0:03:26.579
to have a chance to try all this. You can

0:03:24.870,0:03:29.400
see that there are quite a few that are

0:03:26.579,0:03:31.229
very interesting. We're going to end the

0:03:29.400,0:03:34.139
chapter by looking at states and

0:03:31.229,0:03:37.229
transitions. A state is a group of

0:03:34.139,0:03:39.329
properties that are applied to your QML element.

0:03:37.229,0:03:41.939
If you look at this rectangle here,

0:03:39.329,0:03:44.759
it has this width, this height, this colour.

0:03:41.939,0:03:48.209
You can consider that to be the state

0:03:44.759,0:03:49.919
this rectangle is as. If, for example,

0:03:48.209,0:03:52.769
one of these properties changes, it goes

0:03:49.919,0:03:54.419
in another state. This is what states are

0:03:52.769,0:03:56.159
about. And I don't expect you to

0:03:54.419,0:03:58.859
understand all this now. We're going to

0:03:56.159,0:04:00.840
explain this in the chapter. Transitions

0:03:58.859,0:04:03.299
are a way for you to go from one state

0:04:00.840,0:04:05.129
to another. And you can animate these

0:04:03.299,0:04:07.229
changes. And we're going to see exactly

0:04:05.129,0:04:09.419
how you do that in a few upcoming lectures.

0:04:07.229,0:04:11.519
I don't know about you but I

0:04:09.419,0:04:13.979
think this is the most exciting part of

0:04:11.519,0:04:16.079
working with QML. The next lecture

0:04:13.979,0:04:19.609
we're going to look at transforms in detail.

0:04:16.079,0:04:19.609
I'll see you there.
