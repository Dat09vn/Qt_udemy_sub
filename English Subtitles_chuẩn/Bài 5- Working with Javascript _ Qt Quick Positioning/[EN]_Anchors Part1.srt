1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
In this lecture, we are exploring anchors

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,910
in a little bit more detail. To play with

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,039
anchors, we are going to build something

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,620
like this. We are going to have a breed

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,080
of elements, and some elements are going

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,320
to be positioned in relation to the

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,660
position of other elements. And now we're

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,730
going to start the QT creator project.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,740
I'll show you how you can do this using

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,349
anchors. File, new project, Qt quick

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,710
application. We call it "anchors demo" and

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,219
save it in location on our drive. I

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,559
actually want to use this as the default

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,110
project location. Hit "Next", choose the Qt

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,090
version - the latest one you have

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,950
installed, and choose our kit. We are

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,379
going to change this title to "anchors

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,820
demo". We are going to start by putting a

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,660
rectangle inside. This is the rectangle

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,039
that is going to contain other

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,090
rectangles, so we call it container..

22
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,310
containerRecID. Its width is going

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,450
to be 300. Height is going to be the same

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,860
as width. And this is property binding in

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,170
action here, the height depends on the

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,759
width. We wanted to have a border that is

27
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,590
visible in black. And it should be

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,430
centered in the parent. If you come here

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,780
in the documentation and search for a

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,430
positioning with anchors, you're going to

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,000
see the entry here, click on it, and they

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,850
say Qt Quick provides a way to layout 

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,000
items using the concept of anchors. Each

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,240
item can be thought of as having a set

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,689
of seven invisible "anchor lines", and you

36
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,939
can see them here. You can position items

37
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,920
following this lines. For example, these

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,170
two rectangles from left to right are

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,300
aligned using this piece of code here.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,810
You define the first rectangle like this

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,870
and then you define rectangle 2, and then

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,099
you define the left side of rectangle 2

43
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,790
to be anchored to the right side of

44
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,430
rectangle 1. This is how you say what is

45
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,860
happening here. Down here, we have another

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,380
slightly more interesting example.

47
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,900
Rectangle 1 and rectangle 2 are

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,230
positioned using this piece of code here.

49
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,230
The left side of rectangle 2 is aligned

50
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,920
to the right side of rectangle 1, and the

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,459
top side of rectangle 2 is aligned to

52
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,950
the bottom of rectangle 1. And this is

53
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,350
how you say this. We are actually going

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,780
to go back to Qt creator and position

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,900
our rectangles using this technique.

56
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,180
Define your first rectangle. Remember, we

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,120
want to position our nine rectangles in

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,040
a grid. This one is going to be topLeftRecId.

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,069
It's width is going to be 100.

60
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:14,870
Its height is going to be the same at

61
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,180
the width. It's going to have a color of

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,700
magenta. We are going to copy this, paste

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,640
it down here. This is going to be the topCenter.

64
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,060
It's going to be yellow-green.

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,900
Let's spell this correct. And we want to

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,510
position it to the right of the top left

67
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,549
rectangle, so we are going to take its

68
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,299
left side and anchor it to the right

69
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,150
side of the top left rectangle. We are

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,769
going to say "anchors.left" and set this

71
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,400
to be get the right side of the top left

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,430
rectangle. Let's run and see what we have

73
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,950
so far. mm-hmm.

74
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,120
we have two rectangles. The left side of

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,760
the second rectangle is aligned to the

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,519
right side of the first one. I hope this

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,260
makes sense. We are going to keep moving

78
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,180
forward. We are going to copy this and

79
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,320
define our third rectangle the same way. 

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:33,810
This going to be topRight. It's going to be dodgerblue.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,830
Why not? And it's going to be to the

82
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,370
right of the top center rectangle, so

83
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,360
we're going to replace this with

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,290
top center rectangle. Run. We're going to have

85
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,230
the third rectangle, okay, position to the

86
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,950
right of the second one. We are going to

87
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,820
copy this, paste it here. We are going to

88
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,450
call this rectangle "centerLeft",

89
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,700
something like this. And it needs to be

90
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,120
to the bottom of the top left rectangle.

91
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,870
so we are going to say "anchors". We are

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,870
going to anchor a top side to the

93
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,890
bottom side of the top left rectangle. So

94
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:33,870
anchors.top: top...bottom, okay. It's going

95
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,990
to be to the bottom of the top left

96
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,760
rectangle. What is going to be the color?

97
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,410
Why not

98
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,470
red? Let's run. mm-hmm. The red rectangle

99
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,350
is here. It is to the bottom of this one.

100
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,650
So when you add your element and not

101
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,020
give it an even position, it's going to

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,840
be positioned in the top left corner of

103
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,660
its parent rectangle. Let's show you what

104
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
I mean. I'm going to add this rectangle

105
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,710
here and not give it an anchor property.

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,710
It is going to be to the top of the top

107
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,530
left rectangle, basically at zero zero

108
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,990
position. So you need to move it for it

109
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,410
to be visible, and not wrap around the

110
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,810
other rectangle. And this is what we did

111
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,000
here with this property. And if we run

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,130
again, things are going to be normal. I

113
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,650
want you to know this. We need to add a

114
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,080
few other rectangles to complete our

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
grid. We're going to copy this, paste it

116
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,060
again here. Let's do "centerCenter.." Let's

117
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,300
make it green.

118
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,199
We can choose to align it in position to

119
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,199
the top center rectangle where we put it

120
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,199
to the bottom of it or to the right of

121
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,240
this rectangle that we just defined here.

122
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,599
It's going to work the quality the same,

123
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,979
effectively putting it in the middle of

124
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,740
the grid. Okay. So let's try the first one.

125
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,810
we're going to align its left side, okay.

126
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,759
It's going to be to the right of this

127
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,370
rectangle here. But we also need to move

128
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,800
it to the bottom. So to move it to the

129
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,280
bottom, we have to align it in relation

130
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,319
to any rectangle here on the top. For

131
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,449
example, let's do that in relation to

132
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,120
this top right rectangle here, so we're

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,620
going to say anchors...top...topRight

134
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,009
rectangle...bottom. Let's run the

135
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,729
application ,and this is what we want. The

136
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,729
green rectangle is in the middle. Let's

137
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:45,770
copy this, do "centerRight", it's going to

138
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,270
be blue. The left side of it is going to

139
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,800
be to the right of the green rectangle,

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,419
we can do that. Okay.

141
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,990
Effectively putting it here on x

142
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,029
coordinate, and we need to position it

143
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:04,880
vertically too, so we can do the same

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,759
thing we did here. You can do that, so

145
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,830
we're going to say anchor (stop), equals top

146
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,069
right rectangle...bottom. Let's copy this.

147
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:20,810
Put this here. Okay. We have our blue

148
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,210
rectangle. And obviously, there are

149
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,099
different ways you can do this. You can

150
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,259
just look at the position of your anchor

151
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,969
lines and decide how you want to

152
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,240
position your elements in the grid. We

153
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,370
are going to do the bottom line of our

154
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,279
grid very quick. I am going to paste in

155
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,179
the rectangle here and say "bottomLeftRecId".

156
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,370
Okay, positioning is very easy as

157
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,769
usual. We're going to put it to the bottom

158
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,339
of the centerCenterRecId. Let's do

159
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,029
that, so we are going to say anchor.right

160
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:04,399
center to the left. Okay. This is

161
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,550
what you want. Okay, its right side is

162
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,769
going to be anchored to the left side of

163
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,410
the green rectangle. Putting it on this

164
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,869
line here, horizontally and  anchor.top

165
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:25,089
is going to be "center...RecId.bottom".

166
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,470
We are going to give it a color of royal.

167
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,889
And if you hover over this color, you're

168
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,629
going to see what it looks like. Let's

169
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:38,360
run the application. This is our

170
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,720
rectangle. The bottom line of this grid

171
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,759
is going to be all positioned in

172
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,779
relation to the centerCenterRecId. 

173
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,420
Let's see how we can do that,

174
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:56,929
so "bottomCenter", we are going to put it

175
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,029
to the bottom of the centerRecId, 

176
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,660
this is not changing but the left side

177
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,759
of it is going to be anchored to the

178
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,999
left side of centerCenterRec, so we are

179
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,790
going to say "anchors.left..centerCenterRecId,left".

180
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,959
What color do we put in

181
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,199
here? why not do yellow?

182
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:26,569
Let's run. mm-hmm. Yellow rectangle. We

183
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,329
have one left.

184
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:38,059
Copy this, paste here, say "bottomRightRecId".

185
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's make this pink. The bottom

186
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,899
side of it is going to be to the bottom

187
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,129
of the centerRec, but the left side

188
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,089
of that is going to be aligned to the

189
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,449
right side of the center rectangle. I

190
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,579
don't know if this makes sense. Let's run

191
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,509
to see that our grid is complete. Okay.

192
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:05,150
Now hopefully, you know how to use

193
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,310
anchors to position your elements

194
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,470
wherever you want to put it in this

195
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,020
structure. Okay. You basically have these

196
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,980
lines to anchor against and if you need

197
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,080
more examples of how you can do this

198
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,540
things, you can come on these examples and

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:00:00,000
try to run them.
