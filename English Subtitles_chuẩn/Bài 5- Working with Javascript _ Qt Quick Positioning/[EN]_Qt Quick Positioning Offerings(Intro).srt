00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,829
In this lecture, we are looking at

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,920
different ways that Qt Quick gives you to

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,049
lay out your components in the user

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,750
interface. We have actually looked at

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,900
some of these ways. One is to use direct

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,330
positioning where you specify the x

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,760
coordinate and the y coordinate for your

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,250
element. And this is called direct

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,680
positioning we have seen this. You can

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,250
also position your elements, depending on

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,160
other elements position. For example, here

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,700
you see rectangle 2 is positioned

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,590
depending on the location of rectangle 1.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,190
The top side of rectangle 2 is aligned

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,739
with the bottom side of rectangle 1. And

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,489
the left side of rectangle 2 is aligned

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,280
with the right side of rectangle 1. And

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,489
you use anchors to do this. We have been

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,000
using anchors a lot so far, but this time

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,039
we are going to try to explain them a

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,280
little bit more. QML also makes row,

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,739
column and grid components available to

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,989
you and you can use them to position

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,689
your elements from left to right, top to

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,020
bottom or in a grid like structure like

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,600
this. The layout components respectively

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,299
row layout, to column layout and grid

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,509
layout, provide the same features as row,

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,420
column and grid, but they provide more

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,790
convenience features like resizing your

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,060
windows when the parent window changes

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,829
its size. We're going to see how this

33
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,140
works. In the next few lectures, we are

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,030
going to talk about these subjects in a

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,400
little bit more detail. Starting in the

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,170
next one. I'll see you in the next

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:00:00,000
lecture.
