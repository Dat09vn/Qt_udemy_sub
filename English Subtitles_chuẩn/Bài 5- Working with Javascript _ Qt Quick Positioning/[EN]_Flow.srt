1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
In this lecture, we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,130
the flow qml component. According to the

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,770
documentation, the flow item positions

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,059
its child items like words on a page,

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,650
wrapping them to create rows or columns

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,800
of items. This is really all this

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
component does. We're going to create a

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,119
new project and play with this thing. File,

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,960
new project,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,539
It's a QT Quick Application. We're going

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,300
to call it "flow demo", stir it in the

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,469
usual location, hit "next", choose your

13
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,110
latest version of Qt, and choose your

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,360
kit. And we have our project here. We want

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,850
to change the title here and make it say

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,079
"flow demo". And inside, we want to put a

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,440
flow component. Inside, ID is going to be

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,090
container. Width is going to be, let's

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,619
spell width correctly, and the height is

20
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,869
going to be the height of the parent. To

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,909
speed things up, I'm going to put in a

22
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,310
few rectangles that I have prepared

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,530
before. This one is a regular rectangle

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,500
with an ID, width and the height, a color and

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,869
inside we have a text element that is

26
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,110
centered in the rectangle. And it has a

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,229
black color, a font.pointSize of 30 and

28
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,049
the text inside, the text element, is

29
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,960
going to be 1. Let's hit control + A and

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,170
control + I to align things nicely. And we

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,299
want to add more rectangles like this. We

32
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,759
want to do a grid structure like we've

33
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,040
been doing in the last few lectures. We

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,790
put in the top center rectangle looks

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,540
like this.

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,920
The color is beige, the size is 100 100

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,350
width and height, and his text is saying 2. 

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,460
Control + A, Control + I to align things.

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,689
We put in the top right rectangle, we put

40
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,739
in the left center rectangle, we put in

41
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,410
our Center rectangle, right center

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,400
rectangle, bottom left rectangle, bottom

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,520
Center rectangle, and finally bottom

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,880
right rectangle. We need to hit Control + A, 

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,420
Control + I to align these things. And I

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,750
want to collapse this rectangle so that

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,870
we see what we have in here, very easily,

48
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,540
to basically have a flow component and

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,240
rectangles inside and it is nine

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,850
rectangles, and we can run to see what

51
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,090
our application looks like. mm-hmm.

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,900
You see that our rectangles are laid out

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,130
from left to right. And when the width is

54
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,430
not enough to contain them, they wrap to

55
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,630
the next line just like text flows in a

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,310
page. And I think that's a really good

57
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,490
comparison to help people understand how

58
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,790
the flow component works. Okay, if we try

59
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,550
and extend the width, you see that they

60
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,240
try and fill the available width. As the

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,850
width decreases, we start wrapping to the

62
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,020
next lines. And if we keep decreasing the

63
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,390
size of the width enough, we're going to

64
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,340
have a grid structure like we've had

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,130
before. And you see that it flows from

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,510
left to right and from top to bottom.

67
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,520
Okay, a property we can set inside the

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,780
flow component is the flow property,

69
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:46,140
which can be flow left to right. Okay,

70
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,230
which is what we have by default. We're

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,470
not going to see any difference, left to

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,200
right, but it can also be ToptoBottom.

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,410
Okay, something like this. We run and we

74
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,840
should see one, two, three from top to

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,970
bottom and it's going to wrap to the

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,590
columns as we run out of height to

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,590
contain our items. This is how you use

78
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,570
the flow property if you happen to need

79
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,640
this behavior. We're going to comment

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,829
this out. We can also do a layout

81
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,840
direction, like we did for the grid

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,410
layout component.

83
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,490
It can be Qt.RightToLeft. Let's run

84
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,190
and we should have one, two, three

85
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,590
starting from the right. Okay, you see

86
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,470
this is the behavior we have. It can also

87
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,270
be left to right. Run again, which is the

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,670
default behavior. And you might think

89
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,210
what could happen if we try and combine

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,120
flow and layout direction. So let's do

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,030
flow.TopToBottom and the layout

92
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,400
direction of right to left. What do we

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,060
have?

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,910
Let's run. mm-hmm, so it flows from top to

95
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,060
bottom, but it starts from the right

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,580
rather than starting to the left as we

97
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,300
had in the default behavior. And you can

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,970
try and match different values for flow

99
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,310
and layout direction and see the result

100
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,530
of what you have. Another property we

101
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,860
have seen in positioners and QT quick

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,890
layout is the spacing property which we

103
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,930
also have in the flow component. So we

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,060
can say "spacing", let's say 20, and if we

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,740
run, we're going to have some spacing

106
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,460
between the elements. Okay, what we just

107
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,070
saw is a section of what is really

108
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,040
available from the flow component. If you

109
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,810
need to have more information, you can

110
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,419
read on all these properties and see how

111
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,890
you can use them in your real

112
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,710
application. And as this is the last

113
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,320
lecture in positioners, I think this is a

114
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,530
good time to wrap up what we just saw. So

115
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,440
this is the documentation entry for Qt

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,990
Quick layouts. We just saw that they

117
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,680
allow you to world resizable pieces of

118
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
user interfaces. This is what you most

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
likely to use them for. All these layouts

120
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,090
are available to you. We used column

121
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,790
layout, grid layout and row layout, but

122
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,940
feel free to try stack layout. We also

123
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,990
saw positioners which are row, column and

124
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,600
grid. We use this and we saw how you can

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,910
blow the structures

126
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,400
like this. You use them when resizing is

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,830
not really your concern and they work

128
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,500
pretty well. And if you scroll down, you

129
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,150
can see more information about these

130
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,760
components. You see the column. This is

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,670
how your word done. You see the row. This

132
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,530
is how your world. You see

133
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,590
here, down here, we have a grid, we have a

134
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,710
flow component. These are different ways

135
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,500
to use positioners. They also say that

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,420
there are several other ways to position

137
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,210
items in a user interface. You can use

138
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,240
the basic technique of specifying their

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,000
x and y coordinates directly. We saw that. 

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,030
You can also position elements relative

141
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,550
to other items with anchors and we also

142
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,920
looked at that. So when you need to

143
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,320
position elements in your user interface,

144
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,570
you have all these things in your

145
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,110
astronaut to really build what you want

146
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,620
and use the most flexible way. These

147
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,480
covers all I have to say in this chapter.

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,520
In the next chapter, we're going to keep

149
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,920
exploring more concepts on QT quick

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,790
development.

151
00:07:41,790 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you in the next chapter.
