00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
In this lecture, we're looking at how you

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,540
can import some an external javascript

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,540
code in your QML file and use it

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,480
directly. Let's go to QT creator and

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,420
play with us. Okay, here we are in QT

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,460
creator. We are going to create a new

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,699
project. We're going to call it

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,590
JavaScript import demo. Hit "Next", choose

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,220
your QT version, choose your desktop kit

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,150
here, and finish. What we're going to do

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,690
is to change the title here. We are going

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,950
to put a rectangle inside. Width is going

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,260
to be 300, height is going to be 100. It's

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,190
great to be blue. And it's going to be

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:55,800
centered in the parent. In start, we are

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,730
going to have a text element. This text

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,090
is going to say "Click Me". It's going to

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,670
be in the center as well. And the parent

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,010
of the text is this rectangle here, so

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,200
the text is going to be in the middle of

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,310
this rectangle here. We also want to put

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,830
a MouseArea that is going to fill this

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,229
rectangle. I should put this inside the

24
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,329
rectangle. It's going to fill the

25
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:37,229
rectangle. And when it's clicked, we want

26
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,840
to do something. For now, we can

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,470
console.log "Hello there". If you run the

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,479
application, there's nothing special.

29
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,189
You're going to see a rectangle in the

30
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,229
middle. It's going to have some text

31
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,689
inside and when you click, it's going to

32
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,500
say "hello there" in the console. The color

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,049
is really not good. So I think I should

34
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,439
change this to green. Let's see how it

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,199
looks. Or yellow green. We've used this

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,709
before.

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,150
Yellow-green. It looks like this. I think

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,560
it's going to be better. Okay, this is

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,140
better. If you click it says "hello there".

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,870
So what we want to do is to add a new

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,900
javascript file and call a method inside

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,690
there and let it say "hello there". We

43
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,580
don't want to say "hello there" directly.

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,560
We want this to come from a piece of

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,930
code that is stored in an external

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,860
javascript file. That's all go. We want to

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,190
come to the QML that qrc file

48
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,010
here, and add the new file. So we're going

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,800
to click add new Qt, JS file and call

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,300
it utilities, one, because it's going to

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,600
contain somethings that we want to use.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,910
And you're going to see that under the

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,310
main QML file, we have a new javascript

54
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,690
file. Its extension is JS. We're going

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,210
to get rid of the content and put in our

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,620
function. It's going to be called "greeting".

57
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,750
And inside, it is going to say the

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,940
same thing we had. In the onClicked,

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,490
handler, okay, just like this we have a

60
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,580
function in the external javascript file.

61
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,760
We are going to save it. Come back to the

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,670
QML file, and now we need a way to import

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,610
our JavaScript code. The way you do that,

64
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:49,620
we're going to say import "utilities1.js".

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,610
And you're going to say as and you

66
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,950
specify a name that you're going to use

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,730
to call methods from this file. We call

68
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,640
this utilities 1, starting with capital.

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,700
And down here, we can say utilities one

70
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,500
greetin. You see that the method is even

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,140
recognized in the autocomplete feature

72
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,870
of QT creator. If you run the

73
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,530
application, click here. You see that it

74
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,020
says "hello there", 

75
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,259
but the message here is coming from an

76
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,080
external javascript file. Let's prove it

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:41,669
by adding something here. Save this. Run

78
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:49,319
again. And you see that it says "hello

79
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,409
there" from external javascript file. And

80
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,050
it really is this easy to call methods

81
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,509
from an external javascript file. You

82
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:59,729
just added to your resources just like

83
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,520
you add QML files. You put your methods

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,210
in there.

85
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,479
When you import it in QML, take note of

86
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,970
this syntax here, you specify your file

87
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,940
in quartz. And you specify a name, you're

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,800
going to use to call your methods and

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,990
then you call it. And everything is going

90
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,150
to be fine. And this is really all I had

91
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,400
to say in this lecture in showing you

92
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,979
how you can call javascript from an

93
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,310
external file in your QML file. In the

94
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,960
next lecture, we're going to see ways you

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,360
can import your JavaScript indirectly.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:00:00,000
I see you in the next lecture.
