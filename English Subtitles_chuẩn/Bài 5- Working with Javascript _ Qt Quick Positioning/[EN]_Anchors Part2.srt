1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,970
Now I want to introduce a concept of

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,960
margins.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,809
You can specify top margin to your

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,100
element, a left margin, right margin and a

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,040
bottom margin, and you use this syntax

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
here. So for example, we can come to our

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,730
grid here and look at the centerCenterRec,

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,970
which is here. It is positioned

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,670
to the bottom side of the top right

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,520
rectangle. So for example, if we wanted to

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,239
add the margin to the top of it, we could

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,760
say "anchors.topMargin" and say for

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,319
example, 10, why not? If we run it, mm-hmm,

14
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:50,920
you see that it moves down by 10 on the

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,489
top side here. Okay, one thing I want you

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,309
to see is that if you don't have an

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:00,609
anchor property on that anchor line, it is

18
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:03,219
not going to be possible to set the

19
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,460
margin. Margin here worked because we had

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,060
a top anchor set. Okay. Let's try to do a

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,710
right margin. What we want is to add the

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,980
margin to the right here, but notice that

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,860
we don't have it right anchor, so it's

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,410
not going to work. But let's try it so

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,720
that you can see that. So let's say

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,600
"anchors.rightMargin" and say 10 as usual.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,390
Run the application. You see that our

28
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,880
margin is not being applied. And this is

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,220
a source of confusion for many students,

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,510
so I am going to note that here: To have...

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,600
okay, this is crucial. Let's comment this

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,170
out and do a margin that actually works.

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,209
So say anchors.topMargin and do it 10, 

34
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:26,299
and say that: ...top margin set. Okay. I

35
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:30,049
want this to be clear to you. Let's run

36
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,349
again. Top margin is working. And I want

37
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,690
you to see that the green rectangle

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,410
moved to the bottom and any other

39
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,849
rectangle that was positioned in

40
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,370
relation to that moves too. So we applied

41
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,530
the margin to the green rectangle here,

42
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,480
but you see that all the bottom

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,370
rectangle, bottom left, bottom Center,

44
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,209
bottom right,

45
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,670
they also moved to the bottom. So I want

46
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,030
you to know this. Your margin properties

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,000
are going to affect all the other

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
elements that are anchored to the

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,150
element where you apply your margins. I

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,459
hope this makes sense. Another thing you

51
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,870
can do is use offsets and they allow the

52
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,660
position of your element to be

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,310
manipulated using center anchor lines.

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,549
Let's come back to our green rectangle

55
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:24,349
here and comment this out, and say 

56
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,319
anchors.horizontalCenterOffset, say 10. 

57
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,079
Let's run. You see that nothing

58
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,799
happens. But if we comment these out and

59
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,980
position our elements using the

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,680
horizontal and vertical center lines, the

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,040
way we do that, we say 

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,659
anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter, 

63
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:01,550
and say anchors.verticalCenter.

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,800
It's going to be "parent.verticalCenter", and

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,930
run again. Okay, you see that this works.

66
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,300
This is the same as for anchor

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,630
properties, we try to set an anchor for

68
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,810
horizontal center offset, but we didn't

69
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,120
have an anchor to the horizontalCenter

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,280
and it didn't work. I really want you to

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,080
understand this because this is critical.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,840
You can see that if you don't pay

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,750
attention, you can see your elements not

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,120
working as you wish, and don't know the

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,310
reason. This is the reason to set a

76
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,950
margin or enough set and have it work.

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,380
You have to have an anchor property on

78
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,050
that line where you are trying to set a

79
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,870
margin or an offset. Okay, so the offset

80
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,890
property also can work in vertical

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,050
direction. We can say "anchors.verticalCenterOffset",

82
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,850
and do it 10. And it's

83
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,800
going to work. Okay, it's going to go to

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,710
the bottom a little bit. This is what I

85
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,770
mean. Okay, it moves to the right and push

86
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,500
the blue rectangle here. It moved to the

87
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,740
bottom and pushed the bottom rectangles

88
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,140
because they all depend on it. And if you

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,050
look to the blue rectangle here, the

90
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,630
centre-right rectangle, its left side

91
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,150
must be anchored to the right side of

92
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,460
the green rectangle here. Let's prove

93
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,790
this. You can see, its left side is

94
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,250
anchored to the right side of the centerCenterRec, 

95
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,010
The last point I want

96
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,080
to make is that you can only use these

97
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,820
anchors properties that we've been

98
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,370
talking about between siblings or

99
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,490
between parent and child. Let me show you

100
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,040
what I mean. I'm going to come to the

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,350
bottom here, to the bottom of the

102
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,800
containerRec. I am going to define

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,390
another rectangle. Width is going to be

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,940
200, height is going to be 200 also. Color

105
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:09,950
is going to be black. Its ID is going to

106
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,880
be "siblingRecId"

107
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,870
and it is going to be positioned to the

108
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,140
left side of the container, right. So

109
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,050
we're going to say "anchors.right", the

110
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,030
right side of it is going to be pinned

111
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,830
to the ContainerRec...left. If we run, 

112
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,750
we're going to see our black rectangle

113
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,660
here. And as you move, you see that our

114
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,140
anchors are respected. The right side of

115
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,560
it is pinned to this container rectangle

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,050
here. So what I want to show you is that

117
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,830
you cannot anchor one rectangle inside

118
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,040
this containerRec to this black

119
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,340
rectangle because it's not a parent or a

120
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,610
sibling. Anchoring can only work between

121
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,880
siblings or between parent and child.

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay, for example, if we try and take

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,590
these top left rectangle, the magento on

124
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,190
and try to anchor it to the bottom of

125
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,530
the black rectangle. It's not going to

126
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,390
work. Let's try this. We're going to say

127
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,500
"anchors.top" It goes to siblingRec

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
...bottom. 

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,630
If we try to run this, hmm, you see that

130
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,250
cannot anchor to an item that isn't

131
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,490
parent or sibling. Anchoring can only be

132
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,460
done between siblings or between parent

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,270
and child.

134
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,730
Okay, discovers all we have to say in

135
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,410
this lecture. And the next one, we're

136
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,240
going to talk about position also like a

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,970
row column and grid. I'll see you in the

138
00:07:48,970 --> 00:00:00,000
next lecture.
