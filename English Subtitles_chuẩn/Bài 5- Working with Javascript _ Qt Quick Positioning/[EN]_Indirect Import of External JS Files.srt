1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
In this lecture, we are going to continue

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,650
on top of the previous lecture and show

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,109
you how you can use JavaScript

4
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,599
indirectly in your QML files. Let's go to

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,570
Qt creator and do that. To show you how

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,120
you can use Js indirectly, we're going

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,580
to add a new javascript file. Click on

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,760
the qrc file here. Right, click. Add a new.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,180
Choose Qt and choose JavaScript

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,310
file. We're going to call this "utilities2".

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:39,390
Hit "Next", and "Finish". And this utility

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,460
is too far, we want to define a new

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,430
function that is called "add" and it is

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,399
going to add two numbers. We're going to

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,149
return (a + b) and save the file. So

16
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,370
what we want to do is to import

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,180
utilities2 inside utilities1, so

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,489
that we can use it. The way you do that,

19
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,750
it basically is like what we did in

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,320
main.qml file but we put a dot in front

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
of our import. So we're going to say

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,369
import utilities2.js, 2 like this. If

23
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,250
we define another function here, for

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,970
example, call it "combineAges" and it's

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:39,299
going to take age1 and age2. And it's going

26
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,649
to return utilities2 add these two

27
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,670
ages. ok, age1 and age2. And we want to flag

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:02:00,420
here, that we are indirectly calling add method

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,690
from utilities2. 

30
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,590
We can now call this function from

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,520
main.qml file. Let's go there, comment

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,260
this out, what we did in the previous

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,260
lecture. And we can say console.log our

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:28,680
ages combined yield, okay. we concatenate

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,700
that here say utilities1 combine

36
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,260
ages and say, for example, 33 and 17. If

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,550
we run this application and click on the

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,070
rectangle here, you see that we are

39
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,010
indirectly calling add from utilities

40
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,320
here. This is the code coming from here.

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,300
You see that this method is being called

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,770
and the result is what we expected. If we

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,540
go back into utilities2 and put the

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,070
console.log message to prove things and

45
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:21,120
say "method from utilities2 called". Let's

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,480
run again, click here and you see that...ok

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,670
our changes are not being picked up, you

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,800
don't see the message here. Let's go back

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,459
to the QML file, add a space, and run

50
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,760
again. Click here and you see that what

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,489
message is being shown. Sometimes, Qt

52
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,920
creator doesn't pick the changes from

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,500
the external files that you use. So if

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
you don't see the expected result, try

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,140
coming back to the QML file add a space

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,209
or something, and then run again. You're

57
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,430
probably going to see your changes. Ok.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,900
this is how you can import the

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,300
javascript file inside another

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,850
javascript file. And when you import this,

61
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,269
you can only use these methods from this

62
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,030
file. this method is not available from

63
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,850
the main QML file. So for example, if we

64
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,339
come in the main QML file and

65
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,880
try to call "add" directly like this and

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,080
run the application, see that add should

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,310
be imported by important utilities2,

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,710
but we cannot use it directly in

69
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,199
main QML. It is only available in

70
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,930
the scope of utilities1 because we

71
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,600
use this import here. To prove our case,

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,190
we're going to run and it's going to

73
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,650
show an error, showing that the add

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,979
method is not recognized. Let's run the

75
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,470
application. Click here and you see TypeError: 

76
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,900
property 'add' of object. It's not a

77
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,930
function. It is not being recognized. You

78
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,880
cannot use this function here. You have

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,120
to use it in this call of these

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,310
utilities1.Js file. So if you want to

81
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,150
import another JavaScript file and use

82
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,570
it as if it was defined in here, there is

83
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,699
another kind of import that you can

84
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,100
do and that's what we're going to see. So

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,830
we are going to add another utilities

86
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,070
file. Add a new Qt JavaScript file. It's

87
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:37,289
going to be utilities3. And inside

88
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,870
we are going to define a function, call

89
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,760
it "substract". It's going to take a

90
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
and b as parameters. And it's going to

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,210
return (a minus b). This is what we want. To

92
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,180
import this function in utilities1

93
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,880
and make it available here so that we

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,910
can use it directly like we used "greeting",

95
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,940
there is another kind of import that you can do. 

96
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,229
What you can do is called Qt.import

97
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,729
and passing the name of the file that

98
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,289
you want to import, so you're going to

99
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,470
use utilities3.js. And from

100
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,220
now on, it is like you took this function

101
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,430
here and defined it right here. You got

102
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,349
you can call it here or you can call it

103
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,870
in the QML file. To prove our case, we're

104
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,200
going to

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,360
go back to the QML file, and say console.log, 

106
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:45,750
the difference of fifty and thirty

107
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,960
three. We are going to call this method

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,900
from the scope of utilities1, so we

109
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,540
are going to use utilities1 here,

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
substract. It's not available in

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,350
autocomplete, but it's going to work. Okay,

112
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,970
fifteen and thirty three. Let's run the

113
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,230
application. Fingers crossed.

114
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,770
Okay. What is wrong here.

115
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,190
Oh, we say the Qt.import. We should have

116
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,610
said "Qt.include". Sorry for that. Here

117
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:33,960
you say "include". Run again. And if you

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,940
click here, it's going to say the

119
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,480
difference is seventeen. We are able to

120
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,990
call a method that is defined in

121
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,600
utilities3 from the scope of

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
utilities1. Ok. These are two different

123
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,000
ways you can indirectly import

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,330
JavaScript in your QML. One is to use

125
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,960
this import with a dot to make the code

126
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,720
available under a different name space

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,850
and to call that code, you're going to

128
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,920
you have to use this namespace here, and

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,360
we have used that here. Another way is to

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,360
import a JavaScript file and make it

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,370
available directly in the scope so that

132
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,560
you can call it in the scope of the file

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
where you define it. We have used that

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,600
here, in the main QML file where we call

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,900
the function in utilities3 as if it

136
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,780
was in utilities1. And you do that by

137
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,180
using this Qt.include thing here and

138
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,490
you pass in the file that you want to

139
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,789
import. And this closes our journey of

140
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,669
visiting ways you can use JavaScript in

141
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,190
QML file. In the next chapter, we're going

142
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,909
to start and look and

143
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,980
you can position different elements in

144
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,930
your QML, and we're going to shed

145
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,360
some light on row and column components

146
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,370
that we've been using without having

147
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,500
explained them in detail.

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you in the next chapter.
