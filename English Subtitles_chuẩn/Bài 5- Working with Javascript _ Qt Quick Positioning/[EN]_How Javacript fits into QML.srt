1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
In this lecture, we are going to talk

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,210
about the JavaScript environment in QML. 

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,309
javascript is the first class citizen in

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,639
ER qml cool. It has a lot of similarities

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,799
with the JavaScript environment you see

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,760
and things like browsers and nodejs, but

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
it also has some fans that are special

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,369
to the qml environment. It does implement

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,990
ECMA-Script ES55 which is a standard of

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,760
JavaScript that is implemented in most

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,700
modern browsers like Firefox, Chrome,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,430
Safari and this gives you access to

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,460
familiar JavaScript objects like math

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,190
and many others as we are about to see.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,550
We also have QML global object which

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,860
contains the Qt global object we have

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,440
already seen. And we also have tons and

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
tons of JavaScript objects and functions

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,660
that we can use to make our job easier

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,360
when adding some interactivity to our

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,809
QML code. And the main job of JavaScript

22
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,270
is ready to add a layer of interactivity

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,659
to QML, just like it does the same thing

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,200
for HTML and CSS environments. Although

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,390
the JavaScript environment in QML is

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,040
very similar to what we see in

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,380
environments like the browser, there are

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,479
many differences you should be aware of.

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,299
For example, the JavaScript engine in QML

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,850
doesn't implement the DOM API. Its

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,400
implementation of ES5 gives us access

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,009
to objects like math, array and many

33
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,680
others as we going to see. And one thing

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,860
you should really be aware of is that

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,659
javascript is not really documented in

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,970
the Qt documentation. So if you try to

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,280
search for things like date in the Qt

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,320
documentation, you're going to have very

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,049
limited information and you're going to

40
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,600
have to go to JavaScript focus

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,880
documentation online, and I'm going to

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,860
show you one right now. That is very

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,009
useful. Ok. Here we are. This is the

44
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,369
developer mozilla.org javascript

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,920
reference. It is very good. So if you are

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,020
looking for the date documentation, for

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,210
example, you can come here to built-in

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,119
objects, and you get a list of objects

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,669
that you can really look at.

50
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,140
Inside, we have boolean, date and many

51
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,970
others. And you're going to have to come

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,950
here to search for whatever it is you

53
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,060
are looking for. If we click on date here,

54
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,349
we're going to have different ways we

55
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,450
can use this so they give us an example,

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,790
we can run, you can run this example by

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,080
clicking the Run button.

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,510
It basically is very good to test your

59
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,030
JavaScript. To show you what I mean by a

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,459
limited documentation, if we go to the

61
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,250
documentation here and search for date,

62
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,950
so this is a date QML type. They give you

63
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,290
a few things and how you can use it in

64
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,900
QML call. But for more information, you're

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,090
going to have to check the date object

66
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,480
in the JavaScript documentation that we

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,540
just found here. The QML global object is

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,670
the default object you fall and when you

69
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,670
start to write your QML code. Remember

70
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,790
when we are in our QML file, we can type

71
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,940
things like console, print. That's the

72
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,120
global object we are in QML file. It

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,070
contains things like the Qt global

74
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,079
object that we have seen, we have tried

75
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,829
it out, we have used Qt.quit method and

76
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,650
many others. It also contains things like

77
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,170
print that we can use to output debug

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,049
messages. It contains the console object

79
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,420
we have also been using that quite a lot

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,600
when we typed console out to output some

81
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,690
messages. It contains translation related

82
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,790
methods, but we're not going to explore

83
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,489
this in this course, but it is very

84
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,200
important when you want your application

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,260
to run in multiple languages. The

86
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,390
QML global objects also contains an

87
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,900
object we call XMLHttpRequest which

88
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,579
we're going to use later in the course

89
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:01,040
to fetch some HTTP data from the

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,980
internet. The QML global object is your

91
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,010
home environment when writing some QML

92
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,799
code. We also have a list of JavaScript

93
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,260
functions and objects that we can use. I

94
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,810
think this is explained better if you

95
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,850
see for yourself, so we are going to go

96
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,130
to this length. This is basically a list

97
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,589
of objects and functions that are

98
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,370
available to you in the

99
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,400
javascript engine of QML. There is the

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,440
global object that contains things like

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,260
NaN, infinity, undefined. There are

102
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,240
functions and properties that you can

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,490
use. There are constructor properties

104
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,530
that you can use. You can use this, for

105
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,720
example, to create a date object, a

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,780
boolean object, a number object. You can

107
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,910
use this if you happen to need them in

108
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,449
your QML code. There is the object object,

109
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,699
which is the parent of all the objects

110
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,220
in your JavaScript code. These are the

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,130
functions you can use on that object.

112
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,990
This is an exhaustive list of things you

113
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,910
can do. So if you are working with arrays,

114
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,949
these are the functions that are

115
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,620
available to you. One thing we have used

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,100
before is this for each method and we

117
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,580
used it to look through an array and it

118
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,620
was very convenient, so if you are

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,260
interested in this, you can actually come

120
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,260
to the documentation of JavaScript, go

121
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,160
back, go to built-in objects, look at

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,190
array. And if you go down here, you're

123
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,440
going to find array prototype for each.

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,020
If you click on this, they're going to give

125
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,940
you an example of how you can use this.

126
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,849
So the documentation is really good. Down

127
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,590
here they show you things you can pass

128
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,479
in and I think they have some cool

129
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,360
examples if you keep scrolling. So please

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,270
check this out if you happen to be rusty

131
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,669
on your JavaScript. I know I drove

132
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,530
through at you a lot of information, but

133
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,900
what you really need to know is that the

134
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,720
QML JavaScript engine implements ECMA-Script

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,169
standard 5, which is the standard

136
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,180
that is implemented in most browsers.

137
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,389
It contains the QML object which is your

138
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,990
home environment in your QML file and it

139
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,479
gives you a list of javascript objects

140
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,760
and functions that you can use to really

141
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,520
make your job easier. okay. I don't like

142
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,260
to throw information at you

143
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,570
without giving you references. So we're

144
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,699
going to go to the online documentation,

145
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll show you where you can read more

146
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,380
stuff about this. Here you can learn more

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,810
about the JavaScript environment in QML.

148
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,630
They say that it implements standard 5

149
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,110
of the ECMA script standard. You see the

150
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,080
QML global object, the list of

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,699
functions that are available to you. You

152
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,800
can read on this. If you need to read

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,110
more about the QML global object, you can

154
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,210
see this here. They tell you that it

155
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,639
contains the Qt global object we just

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,159
looked at in a previous venture. You see

157
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,199
the print function, the console object,

158
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,289
the XMLHttpRequest object. And you can

159
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,789
look at this if you need more

160
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,610
information about this. Okay. Now that you

161
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,319
know a little bit more about the

162
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,509
JavaScript environment that is available

163
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,419
to you in QML, where can you type

164
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,569
JavaScript code in you QML file? Well, you

165
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,210
can do that in property bindings, signal

166
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,090
handlers, standalone JavaScript functions

167
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,270
and imported JavaScript code. In property

168
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,909
bindings, we have already actually used

169
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,129
it when you did something like height

170
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,949
equals width, multiplied by an even

171
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:27,289
number. This is some JavaScript you are

172
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,779
writing in your rectangle object, so you

173
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,029
can use it like this. You can also use

174
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,639
javascript in signal handlers. In your

175
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,669
MouseArea, in the on click method, this

176
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,529
is JavaScript you are write in here.

177
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,599
There are two other use cases of

178
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,669
JavaScript we haven't talked about yet,

179
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,860
but this is the topic of this chapter

180
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,599
and we are going to look at how you

181
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,060
can use JavaScript in standalone

182
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,550
functions and imported JavaScript code.
