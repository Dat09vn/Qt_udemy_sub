1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
In this lecture we're going to talk

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,080
about property binding in qml.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,450
This is actually easier to show than

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,639
talk about so I'm going to go to QT

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,710
creator, create a project and show you

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,500
this concept. Okay so here we are in qt

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,269
creator, I'm going to create a new

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,699
project, it's going to be a QT quick

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,770
application as we've been doing before,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,289
we're going to call it property binding

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,529
demo and store it in the usual location

12
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,220
hit next choose the latest version of

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,340
qt that we have installed, choose ok.

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,090
And we have our project here, we want to

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,410
change this title to the property

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,910
binding demo. We are going to put in a

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,960
rectangle, id is going to be redRectId.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,289
It's going to have a width of 50

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,170
and a height that depends on the width

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,409
so we're going to say width * 1.5. This

21
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,890
will do we want to give it a color of

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,930
red. This is what property binding really

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,080
is it is to define one property to

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,200
depend on another property. In this case

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,170
the height of this rectangle depends on

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,890
its width.

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,960
I know this looks like a simple

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
assignment of a property but in qml

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,090
this is a contract between the width and

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,220
the height of this rectangle.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,470
Whenever the width is going to change the

32
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,060
height is going to change accordingly

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,189
according to this expression here. And

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,100
this is what we call property binding.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,909
The height is bound to the width with

36
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,460
this expression here. To show this off

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm going to add a few other components.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,899
I'm going to add another rectangle, you

39
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,520
might have guessed that the color of

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,060
this rectangle is going to be blue. It's

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,020
going to have a width of 100, a height of

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,010
100

43
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,170
and inside we're going to put a

44
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,659
mouseArea and when this thing is clicked

45
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,269
we're going to do something. We want to

46
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,569
add 10 to the current width of the red

47
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,090
rectangle. The way you do that, you'd say

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:35,459
redRectId.width = redRectId.width + 10.

49
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,859
We also want to make this

50
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,620
mouseArea filled the rectangle here

51
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,450
so we're going to come on top here and

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,250
say anchors.fill: parent. And we want this

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,409
rectangle here to be to the bottom of

54
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,230
the window the way we do that we going

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,500
to anchor it to the bottom. We want the

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,829
bottom line of it to be aligned with the

57
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,349
bottom line of the window. We're going to

58
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:12,849
say anchor.bottom: parent.bottom. Let's run the

59
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,670
application and see what we get. Mm-hmm

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,410
we have a red rectangle which is 50 in

61
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,419
width and 75 in height and we have

62
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,260
another rectangle down which is blue. And

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,349
when you click on this blue rectangle

64
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,500
the width of the red rectangle increases.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,040
So we should expect to click and see

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,870
this thing increasing in width and

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,030
height. And this is happening this is

68
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,090
what we want. This is property binding in

69
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,579
action notice that we didn't do anything

70
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,280
to have this updating happening when the

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,349
width changes. This is done automatically

72
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,139
by qml and this is what is called

73
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,510
property binding you bind two properties

74
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,879
together and you define an expression

75
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,489
that is going to be used to bind them

76
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,250
together. But there is a problem when you

77
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,500
try to change this binding it is going

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,400
to break. Let's add another rectangle

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,530
we're going to call it green rectangle

80
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:27,520
Id, the color is going to be green,

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,889
the width and height and anchor

82
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,900
properties are going to be exactly the

83
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,130
same but its left side it's going to be

84
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,280
anchored to the right side of the blue

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,419
rectangle. So I'm going to say 

86
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,630
blueRectId.right. And inside we're going to

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,850
put a mouse area so we're going to just

88
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,780
copy this and modify its on clicked

89
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,210
method to have a different effect. So

90
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,139
we're going to say redRectId.height and

91
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,389
change this to static value, let's

92
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,080
change this to 100, for example. Run the

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,710
application and show you what I mean. So

94
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,650
if we click on the blue rectangle things

95
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,870
are normal the width is changing and the

96
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,300
height is changing. If you click on the

97
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,400
green rectangle the height is going to

98
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,460
be reset to 100 notice that the width

99
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,190
doesn't change but what is even worse is

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,750
that if you click on the blue rectangle

101
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,680
you see that only the width is changing

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,020
and the height is not changing with that.

103
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,870
That is because we broke the contract by

104
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,570
setting the height to a static value.

105
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,260
Okay so we set the height to 100 and

106
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,070
broke the contract that was binding the

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,610
height to the width here. That's why when

108
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,789
you click on the blue rectangle only the

109
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,460
width is changing. You might think that

110
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,680
you can fix this by ammm

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,030
for example copying this thing here and

112
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,860
changing this to an expression. This

113
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,190
should fix things right. Let's make this

114
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,789
two so that when we click on the green

115
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,550
rectangle the height becomes 2 times the

116
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,220
width. Let's run the application and see

117
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,719
if this works. Actually we click on the

118
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,389
blue rectangle things are normal,

119
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,680
we click on the

120
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,050
green rectangle you see that things

121
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,479
change a little bit but if you click on

122
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,949
the blue rectangle things are not

123
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,750
working as we expect.

124
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,229
We are still seeing that the width is

125
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,449
changing but the height is not changing

126
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,490
with the width which means that the

127
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,949
expression here is really not working. So

128
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,780
what is really happening when you assign

129
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,180
a property like this when it has been

130
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,669
assigned before and bound to another

131
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,669
property the binding still breaks. It is

132
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,440
actually taking the result of this

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,250
expression and assigning it as a static

134
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,800
value to the height here. And this is no

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,289
different than what we did by assigning

136
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,690
a static value like this. If you want

137
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,430
your expression like this to take effect

138
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,190
when you click on this green button, you

139
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,740
need to do a little bit more work. So

140
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,660
what we are going to do is copy this

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,229
thing because we are going to use it and

142
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:29,270
say Qt.binding(). And inside we need to

143
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,070
pass in a function that is going to

144
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,860
return our expression. So what we're

145
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,610
going to say, we're going to say function,

146
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,280
you give it a parameter list and we give

147
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,979
it a body like this. I like to separate

148
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,039
things on different lines so it is

149
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,849
easier to read. And return

150
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,900
redRectId.width and multiply this by 2. We

151
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,479
are using this ID here because we are

152
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,090
trying to access this rectangle from

153
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,250
another element which is this rectangle

154
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,639
here. Let's run the application see if

155
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
our logic works and then I'm going to

156
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,620
try and explain it again. You click on

157
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,090
the blue rectangle, you see the width

158
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,580
changing and the height changing, click

159
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,580
on the green rectangle and click on the

160
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,870
blue rectangle again.

161
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,759
You see that where things are updating

162
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,630
now. So how is this working, this is

163
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,090
working because we are wrapping our

164
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,539
logic into this qt.binding thing. What it's

165
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:32,510
really doing, it is notifying the qt

166
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,779
system that we want this binding here to

167
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,179
replace the binding that we had here

168
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,659
if you don't wrap your code into this

169
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,580
qt.binding thing it's going to be like

170
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,710
you are assigning aesthetic value and it's

171
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,350
not going to update as you want. I hope

172
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,140
this really makes it clear how you work

173
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,480
with property bindings. And you saw the

174
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,210
need to use this qt.binding when you

175
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,370
need to update your binding that you are

176
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,010
defined before in your QT application.

177
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,990
And the next lecture we are going to

178
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,660
talk about the qt global object which

179
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
we have touched on right now by calling

180
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,970
qt.binding. This is the qt global

181
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,280
object and we are going to tackle it in
