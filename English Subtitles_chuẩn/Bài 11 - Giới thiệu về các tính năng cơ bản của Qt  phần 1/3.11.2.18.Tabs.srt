Tabs

00:07.100 --> 00:12.060
In this video, we are going to learn about a new Qt class, QTabWidget.

00:12.320 --> 00:17.690
Then we'll see how to switch tabs programmatically in the code.

00:17.690 --> 00:24.860
The learning process will be done through an example of tabbed-window created with QTabWidget.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.800
Now let's take a look at QTabWidget. So if you're ready.

00:28.800 --> 00:35.430
Launch Qt Creator and create a new QWidget application project.

00:35.440 --> 00:42.600
Doubleclick the mainwindow.ui to switch to design mode to design this UI.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.880
In the container section, you can find Tab Widget.

00:47.120 --> 00:54.450
Drag and drop it to centralWidget. Then change the layout of centralWidget to either Box layout

00:55.190 --> 00:58.350
so that the Tab Widget can fill up the centralWidget.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.680
The Tab widget you can see has a tab bar and a page area.

01:07.780 --> 01:15.450
The tab bar is shown above the page area by default and it is used to switch between different pages.

01:15.460 --> 01:23.130
The page area is used to display pages that related to each tab. Like all built-in Qt widgets.

01:23.260 --> 01:28.750
You can design the tab window here in the design mode by dragging widgets into the page area.

01:38.610 --> 01:41.640
and arrange them as you normally do.

01:42.120 --> 01:47.680
As you can see from the object tree panel, each page is actually a QWidget.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.540
To change the title of each tab.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.140
Double click won't work.

01:55.670 --> 01:56.810
What you can do

01:57.040 --> 02:02.050
You have to select a tab in the tab bar and then go to the property panel.

02:02.970 --> 02:09.760
Scroll down and find currentTabText. By changing currentTabText.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.940
You effectively change the title of the tab.

02:15.460 --> 02:24.450
Once you selected the tab two in the tab bar. The widget now you drag and drop will appear 

02:24.470 --> 02:25.110
in the tab two.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.870
If you build and run the application now.

02:44.120 --> 02:51.570
You can see how this tab window looks like.

02:51.710 --> 02:56.410
Now we've seen how it works in designing tab widget in the design mode.

02:56.490 --> 03:04.790
We are going to see how we can manipulate it in the code programmatically.

03:04.800 --> 03:10.600
Let's open mainwindow.cpp in the editor. To add a new tab

03:10.790 --> 03:16.030
it requires a QWidget object which represents a page area.

03:16.570 --> 03:24.640
In this example we are going to just use a label as our page for the new tab.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.330
We create a new QLabel with String "Hello New Tab".

03:31.530 --> 03:42.070
Then we call addTab() method to insert this label widget as the new tab to the end

03:42.070 --> 03:43.680
with title "New Tab".

03:47.250 --> 03:49.280
Now if you build and run the application.

03:53.810 --> 03:55.640
In order to use QLabel.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.490
We have to first include QLabel header file.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.840
And now you see our new tab is created using the label we just created inside the code.

04:25.480 --> 04:35.290
Another common usage is to switch tabs programmatically. Qt has provided two methods for this purpose.

04:35.520 --> 04:48.520
We can either call setCurrentWidget() and pass the widget pointer to this function

04:48.520 --> 04:53.080
or we can just call setCurrentindex().

04:53.080 --> 04:58.000
In this case we only need to give the index of the tab instead of the widget pointer.

05:11.160 --> 05:17.610
Since we've changed the current tab in MainWindow's constructor. The application is shown with the new

05:17.610 --> 05:22.020
tab selected by default.

05:22.140 --> 05:27.250
In this case these two statements have the same effect.

05:33.810 --> 05:36.090
By building and running the application.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.580
You can see it works as expected.

05:46.660 --> 05:51.550
Lastly you might want to remove a tab. To do that

05:51.730 --> 05:53.120
you need to give index.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.530
In this case we can remove the second tab.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.420
And run the application again.

06:06.660 --> 06:16.190
Now you see the tab two is removed. In this section we've learnt Display Widgets, Editable widgets, Layouts

06:16.400 --> 06:24.540
and Tabs. They should be able to help you enrich your GUI applications and deliver a better user experience.

06:26.130 --> 06:29.500
In the next section we'll talk about Models and Views.
