Editable widgets in this video we will talk about different editable input widgets, namely combo

00:13.480 --> 00:16.490
box and text edit.

00:16.580 --> 00:21.130
We are going to build an application to preview our text input.

00:21.260 --> 00:27.930
We can use combo box to choose text mode, and the preview will be updated in real time.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.730
So let's get started.

00:29.790 --> 00:43.110
Launch your Qt Creator and create new project. Change the centralWidget to Lay Out Vertically. Drag

00:43.210 --> 00:44.860
a text edit widget.

00:50.450 --> 01:03.560
Drag a text edit widget into the top followed by a combo box widget, and then a text browser widget.

01:03.560 --> 01:13.280
Now we will use to text browser as our previewer and the text edit as the input widget for user to type text,

01:13.280 --> 01:16.210
the combo box to choose the mode.

01:16.380 --> 01:20.060
How can you add items into the combo box?

01:20.130 --> 01:22.050
You can simply double click it.

01:23.380 --> 01:30.720
In the Edit dialog, you can add new items, arrange them, and delete them.

01:30.740 --> 01:35.700
Here we put 2 combo box items, Plain and Html.

01:35.690 --> 01:42.240
So much for the UI design import.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.220
Let's go to the coding part.

01:47.190 --> 01:56.600
Open mainwindow.h, the header file. And the private member variable plainText

02:01.060 --> 02:07.600
Add two private slots functions, updateTextBrowser and onComboBoxChanged.

02:11.560 --> 02:18.930
The onComboBoxChanged to slot function will be used to handle text change to signal when user changes

02:18.940 --> 02:20.300
the combo box widget,

02:23.310 --> 02:28.180
the updateTextBrowser and those text edit widgets updates.

02:30.960 --> 02:35.270
Switch to the .cpp file.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.130
Let's finish these two slot definitions.

02:40.370 --> 02:50.300
We firstly, in the updateTextBrowser, get the text input from the text edit widget. The

02:50.320 --> 02:54.590
document method returns a QTextDocumentPointer.

02:58.940 --> 03:04.380
And we then call it toPlainText method to get the text from the user.

03:04.610 --> 03:12.260
There is another method called toHtml that also returns a QString but that won't mark the text

03:12.350 --> 03:14.010
up the Html,

03:14.330 --> 03:21.640
which doesn't fit the case in this example. Then depending on whether the plainText is true or not,

03:23.240 --> 03:30.610
we update the textBrowser document with a setPlainText or setHtml respectively.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.240
In the onComboBoxChanged slot function,

03:37.430 --> 03:44.720
we set plainText value depending on the combo box which is curretn text which is passed in the document

03:45.490 --> 03:47.060
by the signal.

03:47.190 --> 03:51.040
Then we update the TextBrowser to reflect the change.

03:51.570 --> 03:53.220
Last but never the least,

03:53.370 --> 04:00.690
don't forget to initialize plainText And connect those signals to the relevant slots.

04:00.700 --> 04:01.530
Here you can see

04:04.520 --> 04:11.710
the signal currentTextChanged from QComboBoxber has the same document as

04:11.730 --> 04:12.480
onComboBoxChanged.

04:16.400 --> 04:32.050
The code is now ready to be built. After that, run the application.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.160
Let's find out if it works as we expected.

04:35.530 --> 04:39.970
Try some simple Html mock-ups in the text edit widget.

04:48.570 --> 04:53.110
With the plain text mode,the text browser shows the identical text.

04:53.510 --> 05:01.750
Then if you change the combo box to select Html, you'll see nicely formatted text. And it gets updated

05:02.530 --> 05:04.470
when you change the text in the editor.

05:23.420 --> 05:33.380
Qt has also provided other input widgets.

05:33.580 --> 05:39.750
You can think Line Edit, Plain Text Edit as the simpler version of Text Edit.

05:43.980 --> 05:51.440
The APIs of all these input widgets are very similar and easy to pick up. In the next video,

05:51.870 --> 05:54.390
You'll get to learn more about layout.
