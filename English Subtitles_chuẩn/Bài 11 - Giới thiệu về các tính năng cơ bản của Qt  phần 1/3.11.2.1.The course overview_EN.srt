Hi, i am Symeon Huang.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.520
And welcome to learning Qt5 by a Packt publishing.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.070
I have been a full stack developer for a few years and am very passionate about the UI and UX

00:20.460 --> 00:23.160
as well as the latest open source technologies.

00:25.790 --> 00:31.880
this coursework consists of a complete overview of learning Qt5 including what can be accomplished

00:31.880 --> 00:32.900
with it.

00:33.140 --> 00:40.550
Our exploration of learning Qt5 will include enhancing command line applications with Qt, C++

00:40.550 --> 00:47.120
GUI programming with Qt and the declarative Qt quick application development.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.560
This video provides you with a glimpse of the entire course.

00:51.590 --> 00:58.250
This video consists of nine sections. In the first section,

00:58.290 --> 01:04.080
You'll learn how to enrich your command line applications with a Qt framework while learning the architecture

01:05.090 --> 01:06.770
for example CommandLineOption.

01:06.770 --> 01:11.140
Parsing is very common and useful console applications.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.240
We're going to cover this in this section.

01:15.460 --> 01:20.680
Then in the second section we would talk about multi-threading and the multi-processing.

01:20.820 --> 01:26.980
The difference between them and what Qt has offer to make using multiple threads and process easy

01:28.020 --> 01:33.760
writing a worker class and off-loading heavy job into separate threads to improve your application.

01:39.980 --> 01:46.100
in the world of Internet, It's almost inevitable to do some network programming as in the section 3.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.460
You will learn how network programming in Qt works.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.860
For example we are going to build a TCP server and a TCP client.

01:53.910 --> 01:57.510
Now we're going to show you how easy it is to let them work in Qt.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.410
in Section 4.

02:05.570 --> 02:11.770
We will learn important knowledge about Qt GUI programing such as signals and slots.

02:11.830 --> 02:19.690
It is the bedrock of asynchronous and GUI programming in Qt. The we will learn all different kinds of widgets

02:19.780 --> 02:20.890
in the 5th section

02:23.710 --> 02:30.100
move further advanced knowledge GUI programming in the section 6 including the crucial concept models

02:30.100 --> 02:31.090
and the views.

02:31.090 --> 02:35.170
Surely it also means GUI widgets like table and layout which we covered

02:42.170 --> 02:43.550
from the section 7 on.

02:43.550 --> 02:49.010
We will enter the word of Qt quick and QML .The fundamental knowledge where we cover

02:49.030 --> 02:49.830
first.

02:50.030 --> 02:53.920
You also get to learn the declarative way building a GUI application

02:59.220 --> 03:00.750
then in Section 8.

03:00.820 --> 03:09.090
We will talk about the architecture of QML and its relationship with javascript and how easy it is to

03:09.090 --> 03:13.260
import a javascript to resource file in QML and make use of it.

03:17.600 --> 03:24.240
In the last section Qt Quick is covered so that we can make elegant GUI applications in a rapid and 

03:24.470 --> 03:26.000
declarative fashion.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.830
This includes different styles and animations.

03:38.090 --> 03:43.770
In this video course any prior knowledge about Qt is not required.

03:43.790 --> 03:48.260
You should be familiar with C++ but you don't have to be a master.

03:48.380 --> 03:56.230
Knowledge about javascript would be prefered but it is not required. Since a Qt is a cross-platform framework.

03:56.240 --> 04:01.270
it means you can learn this course on either Windows, Mac or Linux.

04:01.610 --> 04:07.610
By the end of this course you will have a good understanding of the Qt architecture . Be able to enhance
04:07.610 --> 04:14.360
your console applications and create cross-platform Qt GUI applications and also write modern

04:14.360 --> 04:16.280
dynamic GUI applications.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.080
Declaratively with Qt quick.
